know&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;sometimes people will put where they used to live on LinkedIn and not update that so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:26&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Nope, haven't gone anywhere in what a year?&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:27&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>And a.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:27&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Half if not.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:28&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Right, right?&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:29&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>A lot, not a lot of travel, yeah?&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:30&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Year and a half in the&nbsp;two week&nbsp;lockdown.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:35&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Well, welcome to the show so&nbsp;so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:38&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Tell me about what so, so you're a CMO and a CPO.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:43&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>That's&nbsp;that's, uh.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:45&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>That's an interesting mix I&nbsp;I&nbsp;can see how the two are related, but can you explain kind of like what it is you do for&nbsp;acrolinx&nbsp;and maybe a little bit about.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:54&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;I do a bunch of things.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:55&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>I&nbsp;I&nbsp;I&nbsp;joined the company to run marketing and marketing has.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:00&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:00&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Reach in this organization because of what we do and who we sell to.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:05&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;I reach into pipeline.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:07&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>I reach into the product process on product marketing in there and come from a background where this approach really resonates and makes a lot of sense and the way that we collect and build and use data is very aligned to the way that I've.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:24&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>I've built content in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:28&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Interesting, interesting.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:29&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;the&nbsp;the&nbsp;product at&nbsp;acrolinx&nbsp;it&nbsp;it.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:33&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>It uses AI to create content.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:36&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>So, so like what does that do is?&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:38&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Different so we are.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:38&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>It&nbsp;kind of NLP.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:40&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>We're improving content, so we're&nbsp;we're&nbsp;about being improving the quality and effectiveness of enterprise.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:47&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Content so the easiest way to think about what we do is everybody that writes everybody that owns a content organization, whether that's in a development group with technical documentation or product manuals, or marketing content enablement content, internal education.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:04&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>All these folks have a whiteboard in their office and.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:07&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>On that whiteboard are all the components of language, the way that they want to create their content.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:12&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>It's the tone of voice.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:13&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>It's the clarity level education level of&nbsp;their&nbsp;of their readers.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:17&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>It's the amount of compassion, emotion, inclusiveness that they want in their contents.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:22&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>The words that they want to use and that they don't want.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:24&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Use, it's all up there on the whiteboard.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:26&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>They feel good about it.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:28&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>They've defined essentially the voice of their group or their organization.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:32&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with that whiteboard is that it's in their office and nobody can see it, and even if they could, we don't have a&nbsp;writers&nbsp;pool in the world anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:40&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>We're all writers when you go to work, a byproduct of your work is.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:45&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Content, and so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:46&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>As a marketer I get my best content from folks that don't touch marketing.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:51&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>They're just smart people that can create so they don't.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:55&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>They don't care about what's on my whiteboard at all, and.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:00&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>When we were, I mean, the last seven or eight years you talked about.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:03&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>The potential for the digital shift, and I think everybody been using that as a marketing buzzword like digital shift is coming.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:10&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>You got to get ready and I don't know if anybody ever really thought it was coming, but it was a great way to so some fear into our prospects that if you don't modernize, the world is going to change.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:20&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Holy crap March hit last year and the digital shift arrives and now you're only touchpoint with your consumer is through digital content for some period of time and it became really apparent to folks that how you commute.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:36&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Gay matters and then all the things that happened last year from&nbsp;from&nbsp;a social standpoint.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:43&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Language took on a very lead role.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:46&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>And how do you as an enterprise ensure that you're communicating in the voice of your audience?&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:53&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>And that's where Acrolinx comes in.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:54&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>We look at terminology.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:56&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>We look at.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:56&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>It's style guidelines voice guidelines to be able to create this essentially central&nbsp;lexecon&nbsp;of how to communicate his business and then.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:07&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Either your writers in real time use&nbsp;acrolinx&nbsp;in their sidebar and what in whatever authoring tool they're using, whether they're using something like madcap flare or Adobe products or Google Docs or Microsoft or anything in a browser.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:21&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Uhm, you're able to use&nbsp;acrolinx&nbsp;in real time to check there your content.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:25&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Acrolinx checks for all the components that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:28&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>It's learned from your organization to create great content and provide you with the score.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:32&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>You can improve over time or through automation.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:35&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;think in terms of continuous process, continuous delivery of content.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:42&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>I'm checking content in it's being scored delivered back to me.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:45&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>I'm making changes and it's rolling out at the speed of&nbsp;my.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:48&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Development process.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:50&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;at the base of what we're doing, when you think about where we're at, it's&nbsp;it's&nbsp;really about taking content in stream of characters, extracting that content, buying the context of that, identifying.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:03&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Uh, your tokens either at the word level at the sentence.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:06&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Level and then adding in the linguistic data underneath that around morphology and compound analysis to understand what's.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:14&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>In the content that we're&nbsp;we're&nbsp;looking at identifying terminology and&nbsp;and&nbsp;variant detection and then laying patterns on top of that, our proprietary secret sauce to be able to provide that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:26&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>That feedback of whether or not your content is correct on character on tone on terminology, and then that feeds back.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:34&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>To users in the form of guidance.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:37&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Interesting, so it guides the people who are creating the content doesn't necessarily generate the content for them.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:45&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>We don't override and we don't right because customers.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:47&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Right?&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:49&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>If you think in terms of who our customers are.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:51&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Our&nbsp;our&nbsp;customers tend to be the largest technology companies in the world, so think top 20 global technology companies almost every single one of them uses&nbsp;acrolinx&nbsp;and.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:02&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>A piece of guidance might be useful, it might be on purpose, so as an example, when I write through my system and I write the word software.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:12&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>It says Are you sure you didn't mean platform?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:14&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>And why does it say that?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:15&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Because in my world, if we're talking about our product, I don't want my employees to call it software, it's&nbsp;it's&nbsp;platform.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:21&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>It's an extensible platform with integration pieces and an API.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:24&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>I don't want to sell it as software.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:26&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>But I might have meant to say software.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:29&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;I don't want to.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:30&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>I don't want to enforce that rule.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:32&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>I want to provide guidance and if you agree with that guidance, you implement that guidance.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:37&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>We have the technology to override that, but in almost every case that doesn't make sense to the customer.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:45&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;is the input for the&nbsp;content&nbsp;is it?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:46&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>What is this?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:46&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>What this?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:50&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Is it spoken or written or all of the above?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:55&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>All of the above, so we can take in.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:57&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>I mean, there's a number of ways to teach the platform to be your editor.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:04&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>One is to pull mass quantities of content.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:07&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Give me all your great content.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:09&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>What does it look like?&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:10&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Identify what you think is good and we're going to read through that, and the system will read through all that content and start generating guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:15&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Based on what you believe is great content today.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:18&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Uhm, there's also the ability to just go in and into our interface and set guidelines so you can set a tone of voice you can identify how lively you want your content.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:29&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Today there are challenges to all of those methods because over time you're going to learn more, and that's part of what I've really been aiming to.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:39&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Evolve with the product is.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:42&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Gartner, the analyst firm, has said that 50% of&nbsp;of&nbsp;marketers, people that set the company voice are. I don't think this is the word they use, but I.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:52&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Will use guessing.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:54&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>I have a good idea of what my audience wants to hear, so I define my tone of voice.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:58&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>I define the words that I'm going to use I&nbsp;I&nbsp;think I know what people want to hear.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:02&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>And if I use acronyms.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:05&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Go ahead and I take all that information that I've gathered, and I teach&nbsp;acrolinx&nbsp;to&nbsp;to&nbsp;help create content like that and the output of&nbsp;acrolinx&nbsp;is an Acura link score so you're aiming for 100.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:17&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Most customers are aiming for 80.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:18&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>You want to be 80 or better.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:20&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>80 means good, 90 means done, numeric value of&nbsp;of&nbsp;good and done, so no subjectivity.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:26&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>It's just it is what it is.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:28&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>This is either on my guidance or it's not on my guidance and.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:32&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>If I get 100&nbsp;acrolinx&nbsp;score on a piece of content, well by God, that's going to perform fantastically. It's exactly what I think.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:41&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>My audience wants to hear and how I think they want to hear it.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:43&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>The important word in.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:45&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>There though,&nbsp;is&nbsp;I think.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:47&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>I think that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:49&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>Where I want to aim to get to is the ability to create a feedback loop from my audience.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:54&nbsp;Christopher&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;think in terms of support...]]></content:encoded>

looks horrible I.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:53&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>I you know, I've&nbsp;I've&nbsp;been in a few of those places after hurricanes have hit as part of like church efforts to help clean up and

war.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:09&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>I've never been in a war so I don't know.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:10&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>I've seen pictures and.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:13&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>There's a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:14&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>It looks like a lot of stuff is blowing over, and that sort of.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:16&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Stuff, it's just.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:18&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>So, and they're talking weeks and weeks before power comes back on.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:22&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>That's horrible, that's.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:23&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Similar places, yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:25&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>That's&nbsp;that's.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:26&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Probably going to be do more damage from for a lot of things.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:30&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Were you worried?&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:30&nbsp;</p><p>But on a.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:30&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>More positive note, uh, a positive note.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:31&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, on a positive note.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:35&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Uh, we are.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:37&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I am super excited to have a special guest and I say super excited because he's from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:42&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>He's a senior scientist in&nbsp;Jelt&nbsp;at Microsoft, working on scalable machine learning systems.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:50&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Before he was at Microsoft, he was a postdoc scholar at the Computer Science department at UCLA, and this he was doing a lot of interesting stuff there.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:03&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>He was doing research at Qatar or Qatar.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:05&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not sure how to say that exactly, but he has a PhD in computer science.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:11&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>In university.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:12&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Of Modena and or?&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:15&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I'm going to botch this.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:15&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Reggio Emilia.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:17&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Welcome to the show, Mateo.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:22&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Awesome, so we are really excited to have you here.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:25&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>We actually booked you a whole month in advance.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:27&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I've been looking forward to this.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:29&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, because you're coming by way of some of the folks at the Mlad conference.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:35&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And for those who don't know, I'm a I've mentioned this.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:37&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Mlad stands for machine learning and data science summit.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:40&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>It used to be in person I think now it's entirely virtual for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:45&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Uh, but that why I attended M lads in 2016 summer of 2016 and it was uh, it was life altering like I don't say that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:55&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Lightly so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:56&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;Microsoft does amazing work in the machine learning and data science space.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:02&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Very much&nbsp;cutting edge&nbsp;stuff very much I.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:06&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I wouldn't say under the radar, but Microsoft does not do a great job putting its own horn, so we're very excited for you to come on Mateo and talk about this little project that you're working on.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:17&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And what is the is it have a code name or what?&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:20&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>What is it called?&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:22&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Hummingbird should the code name is actually I'm in.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:26&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Don't have any specific internal names for.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:28&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>This for this.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:28&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>OK, what&nbsp;what&nbsp;is GL stand for?&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:32&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>That was my that was my first question.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:33&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>When I saw your bio.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:35&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Uh is for&nbsp;Gray&nbsp;system lamp and is the after Jim Gray which.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:41&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, OK.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:41&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Is putting award yeah?&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:45&nbsp;</p><p>OK.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:46&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;these are the search lab after this name yeah and use within the Azure data organization.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:49&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, interesting.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:53&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And uhm, So what?&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:56&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>What&nbsp;what&nbsp;cool stuff does Hummingbird do?&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:00&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>So, Hummingbird, uh?&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:03&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Is a little bit, uh, weird project in the sense that when we started this project we didn't know if it was going to.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:10&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>To be a success or not?&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:12&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Because what we try to do basically is to uhm translate traditional machine learning models and into neural networks.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:22&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Actually&nbsp;not Internet format into tensor programs such that then we can run over tensor runtime, such as pipers.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:30&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:32&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Uhm, so when we started this project actually idea was hey there is a lot of investment in general pulling into this neural network frameworks and.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:45&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Coming from the Azure data organization, instead, we are more interested in these traditional machine learning methods such as decision trees.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:52&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Linear models were not encoding all those boring traditional algorithms.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:00&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>And&nbsp;so&nbsp;we look at this.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:01&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>The neural network system and say hey how we can take advantage of all this technology that is built.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:05&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Into this domain so you can run neural.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:08&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Network over CPU.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:10&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Over the GPU, then you can use like fancy compilers to compile to generate the transfer programs.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:16&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>All&nbsp;those sort of techniques&nbsp;and we were.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:19&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Kind of struggling.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:20&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>To see what we could do with the with this stack and&nbsp;and&nbsp;what we come up with&nbsp;with&nbsp;is this&nbsp;Amber&nbsp;project.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:27&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;we basically take a.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:32&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Traditional machine learning pipelines composed right feature&nbsp;iser&nbsp;and machine learning models.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:37&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>After the day trained.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:39&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>So first you need to train it using cycle ornamental net or.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:43&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Uhm, uhm, one of those traditional machine learning platforms and then once it is&nbsp;trained&nbsp;we basically convert it into a set of tensor operations in.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:54&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>In the current version we use basically PY torch for doing this conversion and then basically you have a pipeline model so you can do whatever you can do with Python.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:03&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Models so you can deploy it in in it into a PY torch.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:08&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Uhm, deployments you can run over CPU ran over the GPU or you can do the torch script if you want to get rid of all the Python dependency and just have a C++ program you can.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:19&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Do all those all those tricks.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:22&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Interesting, does it impact accuracy precision?&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:26&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Does it improve it?&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:27&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Keep it the same.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:29&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>We tried to keep it the same so we are able to keep.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:33&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>It The same up to floating point numbers&nbsp;roundings?&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:36&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;since we use, you know we use PY torch to run these programs and not like a socket or ornamental net.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:44&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>There are some differences in how they do you know, floating point operations.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:48&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;the.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:49&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Accuracy is up to&nbsp;roundings&nbsp;in the Floating Points, which sometimes are actually.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:54&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>It can be quite a bit, but most of the time is really small, almost&nbsp;not&nbsp;noticeable.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:00&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Interesting, interesting, uhm.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:03&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Do you would you know.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:05&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>If there was like.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:06&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>A discrepancy, or you Dutch as part of testing?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:09&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>It's part of testing.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:10&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Right, all software is tested, right Andy?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:11&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;we have we have.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:13&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes intentionally is that the email.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:15&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>That's right.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:17&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And he has a saying where all&nbsp;softwares&nbsp;I&nbsp;I&nbsp;forget exactly what it is.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:21&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>But what is it?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:23&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, all software is tested, some intentionally.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:27&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>There you go.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:30&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Uhm, so what's the?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:33&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>What's the real?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:34&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>What are?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:34&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>What are the advantages of&nbsp;of&nbsp;of&nbsp;converting kind of a traditional model over to a tensor model?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:41&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Is it?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:41&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Is it portability?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:42&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Is it speed?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:43&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>You did mention that you can run it on.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:45&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>You could take advantage of GPU as well as CPU.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:51&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, exactly so you most mostly&nbsp;is&nbsp;related to speed, so you can basically run your socket, learn model on GPU end to end and&nbsp;and&nbsp;this user provides you know a little bit of quite a bit of speed up we for some of our&nbsp;example&nbsp;we even saw like 2 ordinal Magneto speedups.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:11&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>For some of the models.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:13&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>And uhm, and usually we try to show that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:18&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>If you use GPU.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:19&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Can be much faster, but on CPU we try to be kind of as close as possible scikit learn or the base or the base or diminished model.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:27&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes we can, sometimes we are a little bit slower.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:31&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Uh, but we.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:32&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>We had some really interesting result.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:34&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Like for instance, we did some experiment with some.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:39&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Some folks at the VM and we took some extra boost model and we compiled some training accuracy boost model.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:47&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Uh, using Hummingbird anti VM into some uh, we basically do code generation and we show that the that model that was compiled to Python was even faster than they quoted the C++ implementation that they're having next used, but those CPU and GPU. Yeah, there was kind of OK. What's going on?&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:06&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>This is not.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:08&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>This was not expected.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:08&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Wait, did you say it was faster than a C++ implementation?&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:11&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, I mean if she used.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:13&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Underneath C++ even scikit learn.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:15&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>You know they use like.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:16&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>From C++ library and yeah, using TVM for doing the code generation, they are able to do like&nbsp;a&nbsp;operator fusion which you don't normally have for like these traditional models.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:28&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;we told these tricks bigger, basically that are coming from the neural network.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:31&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Famous we were able to get like this.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:34&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>These surprising numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:36&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Interesting, so that's a real performance boost, and probably if you scale that up into the cloud that probably.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:44&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Means a lot of money saving too in terms of on cloud computing things like, I imagine a company like the size of Microsoft would be very interested in getting better results faster with less cloud compute.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:56&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>You did mention an acronym, I just&nbsp;wanna&nbsp;make sure folks know.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:59&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>What that is?&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:00&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Tyvm what is that?&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:03&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Uh, I don't know what is exactly for, uh, some tensor maybe?&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:08&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Andy looks like he knows, but he's on mute.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:10&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>I don't,&nbsp;yeah&nbsp;I&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't know.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:13&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>OK, I'm just curious.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:13&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>I'll go look it up.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:15&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>There you go.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:16&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>EVM acronym.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:19&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>I think is for tensor virtual machine, but I'm.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:21&nbsp;Matteo&nbsp;</p><p>Not sure if this is approach.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:22&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>That sounds about right.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:23&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Tector,...]]></content:encoded>

She's a super sweetheart with people, but she's kind of iffy around other dogs and she she's super strong.&nbsp;So&nbsp;once she had her mind to do something it takes a lot of effort.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:18&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Light.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:25&nbsp;</p><p>Right?&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:32&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>To corral her.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:34&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>But she's super happy.

Here we have, uh, it's warmer weather. We're recording this on the Ides of March.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:54&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Now debatably, the upwards of March, yes, depending on who you talk to, it's probably the 13th, but I don't, I don't know.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:54&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Well, you are smart.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:02&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>But we're on the 15th of March 2021 and it's starting to warm up. Our greenhouse is&nbsp;is&nbsp;being put to use.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:11&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>We have some seedlings in there and that's always fun and we've got some raised beds out to the side of the house. Those are.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:19&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>There's a starting to come. We're starting to see different things come up. They're kind of colder weather crops, so we started assigning couple three weeks ago.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:29&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>And it's you know it's been nice. I love getting outside and working, especially this time of year. The bugs haven't shown up yet.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:36&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;pollen.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:37&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>The pollen is really low, it's there, but it's really.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:40&nbsp;BAILey&nbsp;</p><p>Oh&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:41&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:41&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>It hasn't affected me yet, so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:43&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Oh&nbsp;good&nbsp;good&nbsp;yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:45&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>That&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:47&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>It's good that time is coming, so let's enjoy it while we can.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:51&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, I totally agree. There's like 2 weeks a year where the weather in DC is wonderful and this is one of those two weeks so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:55&nbsp;BAILey&nbsp;</p><p>Yes.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:56&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>That's it, that's it.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:58&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Uh, so today we have an awesome guest and&nbsp;and&nbsp;this is, you know, in our in our HR we always talk about where the rubber meets the road in terms of you know how&nbsp;a&nbsp;I can you know how data becomes AI now a I can kind of help businesses and I think this time we have an interesting guest because now we're not just talking about helping AI.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:18&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>But we're helping society.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:20&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Uh, and you know, I'll make sure Bailey has a kind of intro speech that if you have little&nbsp;little&nbsp;ears in the car, you may not.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:29&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>You may want to listen to this later or listen to this on a headset, because we're going to be talking about human trafficking and all the sorts of horrible things that happen to kids.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:39&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And but he's doing some. He's doing some great work in terms of leveraging the power of AI.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:46&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>To help child sexual abuse materials that are online as well as you know, kind of human trafficking and all the bad things that happen with the technology we like to focus on all the wonderful things. But there's a clearly a large underbelly.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:06&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>To the Internet and I'm&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;a big believer in transparency because what happens when you I grew up in New York City?&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:16&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Cockroaches are inevitable no matter what you do. One thing is when the lights come on, they all scatter.&nbsp;So&nbsp;I&nbsp;I&nbsp;think bad things tend to happen in the shadows and you know.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:29&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;the&nbsp;more light&nbsp;you turn on, I think the better it is for society as a whole.&nbsp;So&nbsp;with that I'd like to introduce.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:36&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Chris Wexler, who is the CEO at Crunch&nbsp;Krenim&nbsp;Craney I. We covered this in the green room.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:43&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>But&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:44&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Crew on crew nob. It's OK.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:46&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Rudoff crew Nam. There we go.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:49&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I&nbsp;I&nbsp;need to drink more coffee in the morning, but Trudeau is in the business of removing what I like this term that he uses digital toxic waste from the Internet and using AI to identify. I never heard this acronym before, but&nbsp;Sicam&nbsp;child sexual abuse materials.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:09&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And other awful content to help content moderation and his technology is already in use by law enforcement and is now moving into.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:21&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;the&nbsp;private sector and there's a whole bunch of stuff we could talk about, but particularly what's interesting is a for profit startup or social benefit corporation so we can talk about that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:32&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>But I like to work so welcome Chris to the show and&nbsp;and&nbsp;thank him for putting up with some of.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:36&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>The scheduling growing pains that we're having.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:40&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, no. It's&nbsp;it's&nbsp;really great to meet you guys and.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:43&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>The.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:43&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:44&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>I understand having five dogs. I definitely hearing the intro. I understand I like to refer to my house as the event horizon. If an animal comes in, it never gets out, so I&nbsp;I&nbsp;understand.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:55&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:58&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, we are. Our track record is 5050 so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:02&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Uh, I&nbsp;I&nbsp;tell you that dog was better with other dogs. She would she would she bring what a bit of current president.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:08&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Exactly.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:11&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Wow.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:11&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Wow.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:11&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:13&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>So.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:14&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>How did you?&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:15&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Get started in this and&nbsp;and&nbsp;and&nbsp;and&nbsp;your name. Uh, how did the name of the company come about?&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;I think that's an interesting story right there.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:22&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, well&nbsp;kronom&nbsp;is. It's named in honor of a human trafficking child trafficking warrior in Thailand,&nbsp;kronom. Her name is 2 words crude.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:33&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Nam was a street artist in Chiang Mai and actually doing very well. Very well renowned. I mean, did a project with the street kids there.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:42&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>And&nbsp;and&nbsp;said, hey just paint your life and she could not believe what they painted. It was eye opening.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:51&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>And when she realized that a lot of the karaoke bars in Chiang Mai were fronts for child sexual trafficking, she was compelled to do something. And unlike I think 99.9% of the population, including myself.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:09&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>She just marched into the.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:13&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>The karaoke bars and pulled kids out and she had done this 20 times and had twenty kids in her little apartment. When the traffickers came and said, if you do that again, we're going to kill you at, at which point she went north and found a way to do that and has constantly been evolving her tactics.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:34&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>And what she's done for the last 20 years and now she's saved thousands of kids. One of the first kids she rescued just was one of the first stateless, was the first stateless child in Thailand to graduate from university.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:48&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>She's just been such an inspiration to us and you know, I think if you go from top to bottom.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:53&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>In our organization at&nbsp;Kronom, we've.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:56&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>All been confronted with what's going on in the world and been compelled to change what we're doing to try to help.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:05&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Try to help others in the space of human trafficking and so it just made sense to all of us to name the company in her honor.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:12&nbsp;</p><p>Murmure&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:15&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Well, we talked a little in the green room about&nbsp;about&nbsp;some of the other organizations you mentioned. Your brother had started a similar organization.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:22&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:24&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, he and David Batstone started not for sale back in I think 2006 or 7.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:33&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>And it was actually started because&nbsp;Kronom&nbsp;reached out to them and said, I've got 40 kids in a field and are lean to burn down.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:42&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>And you said you might be able to help.&nbsp;So&nbsp;my brother strapped $10,000 to his body to go up to the field and so she could rebuild a space for him.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:44&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Extract.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:52&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;she even started that organization, but they have since been just bringing innovation to the field of human trafficking.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:01&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Left and right, and, uh.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:05&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>And&nbsp;so&nbsp;it's interesting that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:08&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Kronom&nbsp;was it is a joint venture with a company out of London called Vigil AI, which has largely been in the defense and public safety space. Like really doing proof of concept.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:25&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Uh projects, though, like stuff that just you know I the geek in me just gets so excited when I hear what they do.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:34&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>But, uh.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:36&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Vigil AI was one side of it. The other side was just business, which was the venture group that not for sale and&nbsp;non profit&nbsp;started because what we what they realized was that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:49&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>The dichotomy of for profit and&nbsp;non profit&nbsp;really didn't work when you're trying to solve really big problems, it's great for direct service, but when you're trying to solve a really big problem.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:01&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>But&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:01&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:05&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Any bit of money that you get comes with, UM comes with a lot of strings as either governmental. Like a lot of a lot of nonprofits are really, you know, pseudo governmental projects or from a large a large foundation that's donating money.&nbsp;So&nbsp;you're constantly changing who you are to keep your funding.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:16&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Right?&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:25&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>And what they realized was, well, that you know Dave had a background in venture capital, and so they went and started companies what they like to say is they were A cause in search of a.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:38&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>And the first one they started was rebel drinks, which if you're ever in homed or not Whole Foods, is&nbsp;is&nbsp;one of the most popular drinks at Whole Foods and around the many other retailers. But it's one of the fastest growing natural drink companies in the history of the US there.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:58&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>The sole financial partner of velocity. One of the big innovators in the corporate relocation space. And if you're ever in like say, Amsterdam or they just opened up in The Hague.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:13&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Dignita, which is a&nbsp;a&nbsp;brunch place that started in Amsterdam that was all about all about giving women who got out of trafficking into the&nbsp;red light&nbsp;district. Training in the hospitality business. And now.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:32&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>People who go eat there don't even realize it until unless they read. You know the back of the menu because it's the top one of the&nbsp;top rated&nbsp;brunch places in all of Amsterdam.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:41&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>And&nbsp;so&nbsp;you know, we like to say we&nbsp;we&nbsp;can't do good until we do well.&nbsp;So&nbsp;we're building world class companies.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:49&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>All built with social justice built into them at the scale of capitalism because it's a powerful tool and that's kind of why we went into.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:58&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>You know, we decided with AI that that was so important for us because AI is a is&nbsp;a&nbsp;amazing critical tool for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:09&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>And when you know, particularly in the age of COVID, with all of us behind computer screens and not travel.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:16&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>The tactics of abuse changed and a lot more was happening online. A huge spike in. See Sam and the reason we say see Sam and that child *********** is that child *********** implies consent and there is none in that situation and so it's child sexual abuse. So that's why we say see Sam.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:37&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>But as with COVID, what we're seeing is that is a shift of people paying for shows online, or and then they record it, and then they share the image.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:47&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>And that's a critical.&nbsp;So&nbsp;this is a critical new front. Not even new, but a critical growing front in fighting human trafficking.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:57&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>And&nbsp;so&nbsp;AI is the best tool to do that. And my background is I&nbsp;I&nbsp;was in the marketing technology side.&nbsp;</p><p>00:14:06&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Things I&nbsp;I&nbsp;was with some of the largest ad agencies in the world over the last 20 years.&nbsp;</p><p>00:14:12&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>And really was on the other side of it. I was, you know, one of the first customers of Facebook and one of the first customers of Google and constantly evolving my marketing tactics to, you know, sell one more garbage bag or one more motorcycle to a&nbsp;middle aged&nbsp;man and&nbsp;and&nbsp;you know, established.&nbsp;</p><p>00:14:33&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Data analytics practices to&nbsp;to&nbsp;learn how to do that better and you know eventually that evolved into you. Know AI projects and&nbsp;and&nbsp;what I realized was I could do I mean that that was a&nbsp;a&nbsp;good career, but I could take those skills.&nbsp;</p><p>00:14:50&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>And really make it impact and so that's why I came on board to lead this new joint venture. And&nbsp;so&nbsp;it's a. It's an exciting time for me because.&nbsp;</p><p>00:15:02&nbsp;Chris&nbsp;</p><p>Uh, I feel like a lot of my like history has been able to kind of come in here and I have the skills that can really help make a difference and so that's why we're doing&nbsp;kruna&nbsp;</p><p>00:15:16&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Wow, I mean that's there's so much to unpack in there in terms of the AI and kind of the social good.&nbsp;</p><p>00:15:25&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And.&nbsp;</p><p>00:15:27&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>The detection of this, but the first thing that comes to mind is...]]></content:encoded>

But before Christmas, I was thinking about starting a podcast and as a data scientist, I needed someone.&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:01&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:09&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>That was a data engineer that could kind of round out the talent there and&nbsp;and&nbsp;and&nbsp;and&nbsp;obviously I wanted someone I knew, liked, and trust.&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:11&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Found out.&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:11&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:22&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And&nbsp;so&nbsp;it was you.&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:25&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Well, I'm just glad all of the real smart data engineers you knew were busy.

And gosh, it's&nbsp;it's&nbsp;worked out. What are we up to? 180,000 downloads or something? I mean that's.&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:52&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Something.&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:53&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Like that about hundred 8000 downloads. I mean, we're not Joe Rogan, but that's OK,&nbsp;Yep.&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:55&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:57&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>No.&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:59&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Yep,&nbsp;Yep.&nbsp;</p><p>00:01:59&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Yep.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:01&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>But you know what, we&nbsp;we&nbsp;we've impacted.

Yeah, that was interesting, but you know it's typical software development, right? You release a feature and then you debug it. The I have this saying about that Frank. All software is tested some intentionally.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:52&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:53&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Right?&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:56&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I love it, but I also like how, how, how both our careers have evolved over the last four years. And dumb, you know, this being the premiere episode of Season 5 and we have something special lined up, but I'll get to that in a minute.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:58&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Hello.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:03&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Oh gosh, itch.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:11&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>June.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:12&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>You've progressed in your career. We, you and I've worked on some&nbsp;some&nbsp;projects together or virtual Summit. What we're calling Ring Gate, which will announce very&nbsp;very&nbsp;soon and&nbsp;and&nbsp;but. But most of all, is been my kind of skilling up in transition into data engineering myself.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:29&nbsp;BAILey&nbsp;</p><p>Ehm&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:31&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Which was something that when I joined, so this is just a job update about a year ago. I&nbsp;I&nbsp;left the role of Microsoft kind of field sales and I went into the Microsoft Technology Center stick with me. There's a point to this story and&nbsp;basically&nbsp;I was at the rest in MTC.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:52&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And&nbsp;basically&nbsp;I was the AI guy on my&nbsp;my&nbsp;my&nbsp;field sales team, but I didn't really have deep knowledge of kind of the typical&nbsp;typical&nbsp;data engineering pipe work that goes into that role and basically my&nbsp;my. My then manager said you know he's like hey, you know, if you want this role, you've got a skill.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:12&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And skill up I did. And with Andy's mentoring and a bunch of other folks that helped me kind of skill up on&nbsp;our the&nbsp;data engineering side. I looked at it this morning. I'm like 88 hours on Pluralsight.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:25&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Wow, that was from mid may till we're recording this on April 30th. So just about a year 88 hours right now tracking on about 200 four 205 consecutive days of getting on LinkedIn. I'm not on LinkedIn on Pluralsight, LinkedIn learning. I also have a number of courses too.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:31&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:43&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Uh, that is something I'm proud of in terms of career evolution.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:47&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Absolutely Frank, you should be. How many&nbsp;cirts&nbsp;are you up to now?&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:50&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I 87.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:53&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Slacker.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:54&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I know, I know.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:54&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Know, I know.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:54&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>I think I've got 4.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:56&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Ah, now I know you and I did the data engineering thing, so you have at least 11.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:00&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>That's true, that's true. We did that one and you know that was it's just. It's just been a nice journey and I'll take credit for this.&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;I can I was. I was actually pestering you years ago. We've been friends since 2005 and we started doing.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:20&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Code camps here in the Richmond area.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:22&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Together and co-founded RE co-founded Richmond SQL Server Users Group and you know, worked with the net&nbsp;users&nbsp;group and stuff. And I told you as soon as I saw some of your graphic art and Frank would do a keynote for the Richmond code camps and every time he would make movie posters, the one that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:41&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Oh yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:42&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Still sticks out is 1 called&nbsp;devs&nbsp;on a plane.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:45&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:49&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Oh yeah, I loved that one that was so&nbsp;so&nbsp;cool and.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:49&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>And that was.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:49&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:54&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>You know I saw the graphic arts part of it and I just knew I said you, you'd be really good in analytics and data visualization. You should get into by and you were busy doing other stuff which was cool. You were good at that too. It wasn't, you know you. I don't know of anything you've done that you haven't mastered. By thank you. You know you when.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:14&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Things took a took, uh, started taking a turn for you in your first rodeo at Microsoft. You got into it and&nbsp;and&nbsp;took off with it. I don't. I won't tell the story well, but you just really turned around. You focused on data and.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:32&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>You know, I'll say&nbsp;this&nbsp;Frank. I was right.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:35&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Well, with that he totally I. I think if anything I took away is I should have listened to Andy 10 years earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:36&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>You aren't very good.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:40&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Uhm?&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:41&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And that that that that is something that that that that's the big takeaway we'll talk about, kind of that journey.&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;I think that's worth kind of talking about. And I think one of the things we you, and I've been bouncing around is kind of interviewing each other.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:46&nbsp;</p><p>We&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:55&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Like in asking one of us those&nbsp;those&nbsp;those&nbsp;questions we have, so we definitely will do that, but not today kids.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:55&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:55&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:59&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>We need to.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:59&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Need to.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:02&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Today, do we have Dave?&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:02&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Today do Dave.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:03&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Today we have a special guest we have Dave Wentzel. Dave Wentzel is a was a peer of mine when I worked at the Microsoft MTC and that reminds me, I no longer work at Microsoft 2 weeks ago was my last day. I turned in my second blue badge.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:05&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:05&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:18&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And I joined a startup called electrify. We'll talk about them a later day, but I'm so excited to have Dave here. Dave is the data in AI architect out of the Philadelphia Microsoft Technology Center, and he's an awesome guy. Awesome, got to work with. I worked with him when I was in field sales and I worked with him when I was in the MTC organization.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:38&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>It is April. It was a privilege and honor Dave to have you as a colleague, and it's once again a privilege and an honor to have you here as a guest on data driven.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:46&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, thank you so much, appreciate that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:47&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Welcome Dave.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:49&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:51&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>So, uhm, so for folks that don't know what the MTC is. Shocking that there are actually people that don't know what that is, what? What is the MTC?&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:00&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;basically&nbsp;we're a free service to our customers and I'm a data and AI technology architect. We talked to customers about data and it could be anything from just, you know. Hey, here's what we're doing. State of the art in Azure with.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:16&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>With data, but it could also be architectural design sessions where we talk to customers. Our customers bring us their architectures, and then we kind of get it with them. Give them the pros and cons, alternative ways of thinking, and then what I really enjoy doing is hackathons with customers and workshops and just you know, helping them to learn without just.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:37&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Taking a course somewhere so actually using their data and then I guess I'm roughly a data scientist, so we also do design thinking sessions and those are absolutely a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:48&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>We did one at the MTC with CSL Behring a couple years ago and it actually won a Forrester Award.&nbsp;So&nbsp;I'm very proud of that one. And yeah, it's&nbsp;it's&nbsp;a. It's a lot of fun and it's a good way to bring to have executives and business people understand the actual capabilities of data science. And then within two days be able to come up with a use case.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:55&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Oh wow, wow.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:08&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>And&nbsp;actually&nbsp;build a prototype out a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:11&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, the&nbsp;NPC's&nbsp;are definitely like Microsoft Secret weapon in terms of how&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;you know. Although I will say and because we were in the DC and we dealt with a lot of government contracts, we could not say that they were a free service. They were and already included paid for service.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:26&nbsp;</p><p>That's.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:26&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Much, much better said yes.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:28&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I&nbsp;I&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;I said free once and I got kind of slapped.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:31&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>On the hand, say that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:34&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>But you know it, it really is something that if you do have a Microsoft account team and you are encountering any kind of questions or&nbsp;or&nbsp;whatever, and it's not strictly technical, there's also pretty good. You know, we basically wouldn't engage with the business development, business decision makers.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:52&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Technical decision makers all the way from kind of like you know, hey, this is what Azure can do. This is what data can do for you all the way down to OK. What's your problem? Let's build something out, give you 3 days with one of the&nbsp;top Notch&nbsp;architects in the.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:04&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Space and.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:07&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>You know, boom, you know we knock it out and&nbsp;and&nbsp;you know I&nbsp;I&nbsp;enjoyed it you know had this opportunity not come I would have I would have gladly stayed another. You know 5-10 years of the MTC. Like a lot of people do, and it's a fun organization.&nbsp;So&nbsp;with that in mind, today we're going to do something a little different. We're kind of doing the.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:27&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>A contrarian approach is that right, Dave.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:29&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, exactly.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:31&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;this this has actually come up one of my last. This is one of the things that intrigued me about&nbsp;about&nbsp;your idea for the show was this came up when I was working with a we'll just call it a large governmental agency known for its.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:42&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Birds.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:42&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:43&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Tape.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:44&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>That that should keep it generic enough. They basically came to us and say we want Synapse. We want a data Lake. We want this. We want that. And I was like, OK, well how much data you're talking about. And like we have maybe you know 5 maybe 20 gigs of data.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:02&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And I'm like, uh, OK, tell me what are you trying to do? And&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;I kind of pitched the idea like look, you know you don't have that much data right to make data bricks.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:14&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>But you really want it so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:17&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>If you really want it, I won't stop you, but I think it's kind of overkill. I think you're taking instead of using a steak knife to cut the steak using a chainsaw.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:25&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:27&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>You know they kind of came back and ultimately what won the day was they already they couldn't get approval for whatever we recommended&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;it didn't get stamped by there.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:37&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>They're people for security usage yet, and things like that so they end up doing kind of the right thing because of their own bureaucracy, which.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:44&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>It's kind of weird. It's kind of like dividing by zero and seeing the universe fold in on itself.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:50&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>But UM, so the topic of today is kind of like no, you don't need a data warehouse. Did I get that right?&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:58&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Exactly, that's what I believe in, and I believed in it since I was in college and I first learned about data warehouses. I'm not saying data warehouses are always bad, they definitely have&nbsp;their.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:10&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Use cases, but in 2021 when we're talking about advanced analytics and we're trying to tell customers you need to be more predictive than prescriptive.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:19&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>The data warehouse really doesn't deliver.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:23&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Really, how so?&nbsp;'cause? That's&nbsp;that's&nbsp;totally not the power. Certainly not the party line. I'm not going to say which party it was. You can figure it out but&nbsp;but&nbsp;why, why&nbsp;why&nbsp;would you say that?&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:33&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>OK so take.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:33&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>A step back here, right? We're all data consultants, or we were at some point in our life and probably most of the listeners are. And if you've been doing this, I've been doing this since the mid 90s in college and when I first&nbsp;started&nbsp;I had an internship with a consumer package. Good company, they made candy.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:52&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Hours and they said, hey, we wouldn't want to do an internship and take a look at our data and figure out where is the best spot to put candy on a shelf so that we sell more candy to kids, right?&nbsp;So&nbsp;we used data for that at the time that was known as business Intelligence in the industry. Nowadays business intelligence means something totally different. In reality, it's really closer to what?&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:12&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Today we would call data&nbsp;science&nbsp;right?&nbsp;So&nbsp;my tools of choice were SQL, although I didn't know what SQL was at the time and we had this goofy SQL engine and&nbsp;and&nbsp;essentially something called ESP's, which is roughly the equivalent of like our or stats package something.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:28&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Like that and we kind of looked at data as just, you know I have data and let me find the Nuggets of gold and I'm not going to concern myself with schema and that is I think the biggest problem with data warehouses. But take a, you know a metal layer higher right? Talk to the average business executive like a you know a CTO or CEO.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:48&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>And tell them, as a consultant, you're going to go in and build them a data warehouse.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:53&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Instantly,...]]></content:encoded>

Yeah, that was interesting, but you know it's typical software development, right? You release a feature and then you debug it. The I have this saying about that Frank. All software is tested some intentionally.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:52&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:53&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Right?&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:56&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I love it, but I also like how, how, how both our careers have evolved over the last four years. And dumb, you know, this being the premiere episode of Season 5 and we have something special lined up, but I'll get to that in a minute.&nbsp;</p><p>00:02:58&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Hello.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:03&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Oh gosh, itch.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:11&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>June.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:12&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>You've progressed in your career. We, you and I've worked on some&nbsp;some&nbsp;projects together or virtual Summit. What we're calling Ring Gate, which will announce very&nbsp;very&nbsp;soon and&nbsp;and&nbsp;but. But most of all, is been my kind of skilling up in transition into data engineering myself.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:29&nbsp;BAILey&nbsp;</p><p>Ehm&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:31&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Which was something that when I joined, so this is just a job update about a year ago. I&nbsp;I&nbsp;left the role of Microsoft kind of field sales and I went into the Microsoft Technology Center stick with me. There's a point to this story and&nbsp;basically&nbsp;I was at the rest in MTC.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:52&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And&nbsp;basically&nbsp;I was the AI guy on my&nbsp;my&nbsp;my&nbsp;field sales team, but I didn't really have deep knowledge of kind of the typical&nbsp;typical&nbsp;data engineering pipe work that goes into that role and basically my&nbsp;my. My then manager said you know he's like hey, you know, if you want this role, you've got a skill.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:12&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And skill up I did. And with Andy's mentoring and a bunch of other folks that helped me kind of skill up on&nbsp;our the&nbsp;data engineering side. I looked at it this morning. I'm like 88 hours on Pluralsight.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:25&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Wow, that was from mid may till we're recording this on April 30th. So just about a year 88 hours right now tracking on about 200 four 205 consecutive days of getting on LinkedIn. I'm not on LinkedIn on Pluralsight, LinkedIn learning. I also have a number of courses too.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:31&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:43&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Uh, that is something I'm proud of in terms of career evolution.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:47&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Absolutely Frank, you should be. How many&nbsp;cirts&nbsp;are you up to now?&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:50&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I 87.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:53&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Slacker.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:54&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I know, I know.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:54&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Know, I know.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:54&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>I think I've got 4.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:56&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Ah, now I know you and I did the data engineering thing, so you have at least 11.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:00&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>That's true, that's true. We did that one and you know that was it's just. It's just been a nice journey and I'll take credit for this.&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;I can I was. I was actually pestering you years ago. We've been friends since 2005 and we started doing.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:20&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Code camps here in the Richmond area.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:22&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Together and co-founded RE co-founded Richmond SQL Server Users Group and you know, worked with the net&nbsp;users&nbsp;group and stuff. And I told you as soon as I saw some of your graphic art and Frank would do a keynote for the Richmond code camps and every time he would make movie posters, the one that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:41&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Oh yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:42&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Still sticks out is 1 called&nbsp;devs&nbsp;on a plane.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:45&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Ha&nbsp;ha&nbsp;ha.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:49&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Oh yeah, I loved that one that was so&nbsp;so&nbsp;cool and.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:49&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>And that was.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:49&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:54&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>You know I saw the graphic arts part of it and I just knew I said you, you'd be really good in analytics and data visualization. You should get into by and you were busy doing other stuff which was cool. You were good at that too. It wasn't, you know you. I don't know of anything you've done that you haven't mastered. By thank you. You know you when.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:14&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Things took a took, uh, started taking a turn for you in your first rodeo at Microsoft. You got into it and&nbsp;and&nbsp;took off with it. I don't. I won't tell the story well, but you just really turned around. You focused on data and.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:32&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>You know, I'll say&nbsp;this&nbsp;Frank. I was right.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:35&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Well, with that he totally I. I think if anything I took away is I should have listened to Andy 10 years earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:36&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>You aren't very good.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:40&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Uhm?&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:41&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And that that that that is something that that that that's the big takeaway we'll talk about, kind of that journey.&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;I think that's worth kind of talking about. And I think one of the things we you, and I've been bouncing around is kind of interviewing each other.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:46&nbsp;</p><p>We&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:55&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Like in asking one of us those&nbsp;those&nbsp;those&nbsp;questions we have, so we definitely will do that, but not today kids.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:55&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:55&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:59&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>We need to.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:59&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Need to.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:02&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Today, do we have Dave?&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:02&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Today do Dave.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:03&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Today we have a special guest we have Dave Wentzel. Dave Wentzel is a was a peer of mine when I worked at the Microsoft MTC and that reminds me, I no longer work at Microsoft 2 weeks ago was my last day. I turned in my second blue badge.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:05&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:05&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:18&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And I joined a startup called electrify. We'll talk about them a later day, but I'm so excited to have Dave here. Dave is the data in AI architect out of the Philadelphia Microsoft Technology Center, and he's an awesome guy. Awesome, got to work with. I worked with him when I was in field sales and I worked with him when I was in the MTC organization.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:38&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>It is April. It was a privilege and honor Dave to have you as a colleague, and it's once again a privilege and an honor to have you here as a guest on data driven.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:46&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, thank you so much, appreciate that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:47&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Welcome Dave.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:49&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:51&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>So, uhm, so for folks that don't know what the MTC is. Shocking that there are actually people that don't know what that is, what? What is the MTC?&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:00&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;basically&nbsp;we're a free service to our customers and I'm a data and AI technology architect. We talked to customers about data and it could be anything from just, you know. Hey, here's what we're doing. State of the art in Azure with.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:16&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>With data, but it could also be architectural design sessions where we talk to customers. Our customers bring us their architectures, and then we kind of get it with them. Give them the pros and cons, alternative ways of thinking, and then what I really enjoy doing is hackathons with customers and workshops and just you know, helping them to learn without just.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:37&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Taking a course somewhere so actually using their data and then I guess I'm roughly a data scientist, so we also do design thinking sessions and those are absolutely a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:48&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>We did one at the MTC with CSL Behring a couple years ago and it actually won a Forrester Award.&nbsp;So&nbsp;I'm very proud of that one. And yeah, it's&nbsp;it's&nbsp;a. It's a lot of fun and it's a good way to bring to have executives and business people understand the actual capabilities of data science. And then within two days be able to come up with a use case.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:55&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Oh wow, wow.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:08&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>And&nbsp;actually&nbsp;build a prototype out a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:11&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, the&nbsp;NPC's&nbsp;are definitely like Microsoft Secret weapon in terms of how&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;you know. Although I will say and because we were in the DC and we dealt with a lot of government contracts, we could not say that they were a free service. They were and already included paid for service.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:26&nbsp;</p><p>That's.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:26&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Much, much better said yes.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:28&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I&nbsp;I&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;I said free once and I got kind of slapped.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:31&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>On the hand, say that.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:34&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>But you know it, it really is something that if you do have a Microsoft account team and you are encountering any kind of questions or&nbsp;or&nbsp;whatever, and it's not strictly technical, there's also pretty good. You know, we basically wouldn't engage with the business development, business decision makers.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:52&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Technical decision makers all the way from kind of like you know, hey, this is what Azure can do. This is what data can do for you all the way down to OK. What's your problem? Let's build something out, give you 3 days with one of the&nbsp;top Notch&nbsp;architects in the.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:04&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Space and.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:07&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>You know, boom, you know we knock it out and&nbsp;and&nbsp;you know I&nbsp;I&nbsp;enjoyed it you know had this opportunity not come I would have I would have gladly stayed another. You know 5-10 years of the MTC. Like a lot of people do, and it's a fun organization.&nbsp;So&nbsp;with that in mind, today we're going to do something a little different. We're kind of doing the.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:27&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>A contrarian approach is that right, Dave.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:29&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, exactly.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:31&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;this this has actually come up one of my last. This is one of the things that intrigued me about&nbsp;about&nbsp;your idea for the show was this came up when I was working with a we'll just call it a large governmental agency known for its.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:42&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Birds.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:42&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:43&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Tape.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:44&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>That that should keep it generic enough. They basically came to us and say we want Synapse. We want a data Lake. We want this. We want that. And I was like, OK, well how much data you're talking about. And like we have maybe you know 5 maybe 20 gigs of data.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:02&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And I'm like, uh, OK, tell me what are you trying to do? And&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;I kind of pitched the idea like look, you know you don't have that much data right to make data bricks.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:14&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>But you really want it so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:17&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>If you really want it, I won't stop you, but I think it's kind of overkill. I think you're taking instead of using a steak knife to cut the steak using a chainsaw.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:25&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:27&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>You know they kind of came back and ultimately what won the day was they already they couldn't get approval for whatever we recommended&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;it didn't get stamped by there.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:37&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>They're people for security usage yet, and things like that so they end up doing kind of the right thing because of their own bureaucracy, which.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:44&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>It's kind of weird. It's kind of like dividing by zero and seeing the universe fold in on itself.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:50&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>But UM, so the topic of today is kind of like no, you don't need a data warehouse. Did I get that right?&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:58&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Exactly, that's what I believe in, and I believed in it since I was in college and I first learned about data warehouses. I'm not saying data warehouses are always bad, they definitely have&nbsp;their.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:10&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Use cases, but in 2021 when we're talking about advanced analytics and we're trying to tell customers you need to be more predictive than prescriptive.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:19&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>The data warehouse really doesn't deliver.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:23&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Really, how so?&nbsp;'cause? That's&nbsp;that's&nbsp;totally not the power. Certainly not the party line. I'm not going to say which party it was. You can figure it out but&nbsp;but&nbsp;why, why&nbsp;why&nbsp;would you say that?&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:33&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>OK so take.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:33&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>A step back here, right? We're all data consultants, or we were at some point in our life and probably most of the listeners are. And if you've been doing this, I've been doing this since the mid 90s in college and when I first&nbsp;started&nbsp;I had an internship with a consumer package. Good company, they made candy.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:52&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Hours and they said, hey, we wouldn't want to do an internship and take a look at our data and figure out where is the best spot to put candy on a shelf so that we sell more candy to kids, right?&nbsp;So&nbsp;we used data for that at the time that was known as business Intelligence in the industry. Nowadays business intelligence means something totally different. In reality, it's really closer to what?&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:12&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Today we would call data&nbsp;science&nbsp;right?&nbsp;So&nbsp;my tools of choice were SQL, although I didn't know what SQL was at the time and we had this goofy SQL engine and&nbsp;and&nbsp;essentially something called ESP's, which is roughly the equivalent of like our or stats package something.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:28&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Like that and we kind of looked at data as just, you know I have data and let me find the Nuggets of gold and I'm not going to concern myself with schema and that is I think the biggest problem with data warehouses. But take a, you know a metal layer higher right? Talk to the average business executive like a you know a CTO or CEO.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:48&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>And tell them, as a consultant, you're going to go in and build them a data warehouse.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:53&nbsp;<span>Dave</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Instantly, that's a political statement you just made. Data warehouses have connotations of you, know risky projects over budget projects as far as time and money, and...]]></content:encoded>

Sorry about that. He's the president and owner of Turnkey Technologies and they are a Microsoft partner. I did&nbsp;looking&nbsp;around on their website and they are basically they provide development, analytics, training and support services for Microsoft Dynamics.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:09&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>If you don't know what Microsoft Dynamics is, a lot of people don't. In the data world tend to just know it tangentially. It's basically Microsoft CRM system, so welcome to the show, Cristiano.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:21&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you very much. Thanks for having me.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:25&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>It's good to have you here, and so what's the weather like in Saint Louis right now?&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:30&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Ah, it's beautiful and sunny. Today it's about 64 degrees Sun index is just right around A5, so it's actually it's actually nice and better than the&nbsp;the&nbsp;ice. We had a couple weeks ago so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:38&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Knife.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:42&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, it got bitterly cold out there for about a week, didn't it?&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:47&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>That's right, I happen to be in Florida that entire week. Everybody couldn't believe I missed all the fun.&nbsp;So&nbsp;with the IT was good, it was a good week to be gone. We left Saturday. We came back Sunday was 52 when we got back and the 9 inches of snow had melted and.&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:51&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfelt&nbsp;</p><p>00:03:51&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:00&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah, perfect timing.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:02&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Nice, now you have excellent timing Sir. Not only in just the fact that dynamics is kind of coming up, coming up on my personal radar, but also in terms of avoiding bad weather. My first question is and I'm calm. Still a new bit&nbsp;dynamics. I learned a lot just by working on this.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:23&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>One engagement we had DMTC.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:27&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Is Dinah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:28&nbsp;BAILey&nbsp;</p><p>Mix.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:29&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;Dynamics&nbsp;Dynamics&nbsp;is the biz apps. I mean, you said CRM. It's more than CRM. But today dynamics represents a family of products. You know, the legacy on Prem products, Dynamics AX Dynamics, Navy Dynamics, GP, Dynamics, SL and then the current dynamics 365, which encompasses both you know financing.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:49&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Operations, which was the dynamics AX and then Dynamics 365 business Central which was the Navy? So those are both ERP products.&nbsp;</p><p>00:04:57&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>And then Dynamics customer engagement, which is the CRM platform so&nbsp;so&nbsp;dynamics is a collection of biz apps. It's a family of products and you know today we&nbsp;we&nbsp;focus on the two dynamics 365 ERP products and the CRM. The customer engagement product. So great solution, but it's a platform also it.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:15&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>That's what I noticed, and folks that are listening. They're like this is a data science kind of data engineering show. Why the heck are you talking about?&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:25&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Dynamics but&nbsp;dataverse&nbsp;the data models, which are one of the things that blew me away, was on this one demo is that there's a. There's a button where you just basically can dump out all your cream data.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:38&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Or all your data and dynamics out to a data Lake.&nbsp;</p><p>00:05:42&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>That's absolutely right, Azure.&nbsp;So&nbsp;if you think about the challenges where you move from a legacy system to the cloud, maybe all the data doesn't move and you need to combine it in an Azure data like a data warehouse, and certainly all those tools and all the analytics are all part of the platform. That's just it touches dynamics out of the box, so it's quite a quite a degree of efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:02&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>There.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:03&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Interesting.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:05&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;one question I have about dynamics is&nbsp;it's&nbsp;history now. You mentioned Dynamics AX and a couple of other letters next to the word dynamics.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:17&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Once Upon a time when I worked when I lived in Richmond, there was a guy who used to do a lot of work with that technology.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:24&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Back and it was Solomon in Great Plains is that is that the same thing is that the lineages from it.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:30&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>That's correct, that's correct, that's correct. And&nbsp;so&nbsp;the US based products&nbsp;was&nbsp;Great Plains software out of Fargo ND, and a gentleman named Doug Burgum owned that company privately and then his family. They bought the&nbsp;the&nbsp;Salomon product line as well and then in 2001 is when Microsoft bought Great Plains.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:32&nbsp;</p><p>Silly.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:46&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Software, so that's kind of how they consume the North American products and then a year later Microsoft went to Europe and bought Dynamics AX and Dynamics Navy. It was called&nbsp;Exapta&nbsp;in division so and that became a second big purchase and instantly at 2002 they had four ERP products and they're in the biz apps space like they've never been.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:48&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>OK, so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:06:48&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:06&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Before so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:09&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Ah OK, that's interesting.&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;I&nbsp;I&nbsp;now&nbsp;I know why. There's a huge Microsoft campus in Fargo.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:16&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, yes.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:18&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>It's beautiful campus.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:19&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Uhm?&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:21&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, I haven't been there, but I definitely maybe one day I'll end up going but the&nbsp;the&nbsp;other question I have for you. You keep saying biz apps when you say biz apps? What exactly do you mean like what?&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:32&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, so I'm. I'm a technical guy. I'm engineering comp SCI math and there's two directions you go and even those curriculums you go **** **** or you or business applications and so business applications in our context is, you know, we're&nbsp;we're&nbsp;business process automation again, whether it starts in an ERP from a quote to cash or a procure to pay those.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:33&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>What&nbsp;what&nbsp;comic sub is that like?&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:52&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>For business processes and the business applications support.&nbsp;</p><p>00:07:56&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Work, transactional processing or even non transactional if you think about context of a lead to opportunity to customer type of flow where you start even earlier in the process, but it is&nbsp;it's&nbsp;process automation and exception management and workflow and approvals and can go to the NTH degree of complexity. But&nbsp;but&nbsp;it's biz apps in that categorization.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:16&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>So as opposed to scientific apps or development tools or games, for example, right, we're focused on businesses, not on residential applications.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:26&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>That makes sense.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:27&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>It does, yeah.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:28&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Do you have any&nbsp;questions&nbsp;Andy?&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:30&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>This is so awkward being on&nbsp;on&nbsp;this recording, but not being live.&nbsp;So&nbsp;for those that are watching or listening or maybe watching.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:35&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, I don't work.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:40&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Go ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:42&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, I'd like to apologize to Chris, especially thank you for coming on here, but we're a little off because of the video. I&nbsp;I&nbsp;I&nbsp;never shaved but.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:50&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>No worries.&nbsp;</p><p>00:08:55&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>I would have I. I have a face for radio. I think in audio, so that's what's throwing us just a bit. Although Frank and I do live streaming and stuff, can you tell us a little bit more about&nbsp;about&nbsp;what your company does, how&nbsp;how&nbsp;your team implements these biz apps?&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:14&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, so&nbsp;so&nbsp;turnkey is a is a direct Microsoft distributor, so we distribute dynamics licensing and then we provide 100% of the professional services to&nbsp;to&nbsp;plan to implement, to convert, to customize, to integrate. So really, if you think about there's two parts of business, there's the licensing side and&nbsp;and&nbsp;then the services side, which we've got about 60 team members.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:35&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>These days, and as you think about, you know, delivering an implementation once the solutions been kind of articulated as project management methodology, really drive the success of the project, and so there's an intimate, detailed plan.&nbsp;</p><p>00:09:48&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Where we use Microsoft project and&nbsp;and&nbsp;we plan in very&nbsp;very&nbsp;low levels of detail for project execution. Everything from you know, the initial phases of analyzing and requirements and then through design and then through development and through deployment. And then we take people live, but it's a very predictable methodology that's used for project delivery.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:08&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Around the ERP products, so that's&nbsp;that's&nbsp;the first spot, so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:12&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>You know that sounds an awful lot like what&nbsp;what&nbsp;we do when we're doing data warehousing as well and&nbsp;and&nbsp;similar work I&nbsp;I&nbsp;would say.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:22&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Absolutely the disciplines or you know, are kind of agnostic when you think about project methodology.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:27&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>So just curious, what is a typical engagement about how long does a typical engagement last?&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:34&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;and again, we sell 2 flavors Dynamics, 365 business Central. We talk about small, medium and those projects could.&nbsp;</p><p>00:10:41&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe three months for somebody small coming off of a QuickBooks. It's just financials, but it could be six months for somebody that's implementing distribution and manufacturing, for example.&nbsp;So&nbsp;depending on complexity, three months is normally the least amount of time, and in 6 plus months for the business, central on the finance and supply chain, which was acts as a much larger applications targeted at, you know.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:01&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Mid market&nbsp;enterprise organizations. Those projects are typically not being delivered in less than six months. Frankly, and I've got some that we see them take 12 to 18 months for example so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:13&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>No, it's&nbsp;gonna&nbsp;save us the&nbsp;the&nbsp;project management requirement. Because of that duration and scope and girth. You really people get lost right? Anyway, I'm sorry please.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:23&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Oh no&nbsp;no&nbsp;no&nbsp;no&nbsp;no&nbsp;so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:26&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;the, the ERM or the ERP systems like Dave require. So Once Upon a time I was working for a large German chemical company, right? And&nbsp;of course&nbsp;it's a German company, so they used SAP and they hired a bunch of consultants and consulting firms to build out the system. But when they.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:46&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Rolled out SA P R2. I think it was.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:49&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Is.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:50&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently&nbsp;there was not.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:52&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of project discipline now I'll just. I'll just leave it there.&nbsp;</p><p>00:11:57&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>And it basically shut down some of their plants because there were just things were not coming in the way they were supposed to.&nbsp;So&nbsp;So&nbsp;what?&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:06&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>How?&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:07&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>How does ERP systems? How do our ERP systems? Kind of you know if they're done wrong? It sounds like they can create a big mess if they're done right, they could really optimize operations.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:19&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Uhm?&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:21&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>I mean is that, is that true?&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;I&nbsp;I&nbsp;kind of saw, I mean.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:23&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>That was just a Horror Story. It's true.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:24&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>It's true, it's true. It's like me giving you lousy directions to drive from Florida to Washington, and it takes you six months and it should have taken you three days. There's a great example. I poor guidance and poor methodology, is it stretches it out. Things are missed, costs are out of control, but again, if it's done correctly through a thorough analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:34&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;</p><p>Point&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:45&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Then you really define scope.&nbsp;</p><p>00:12:46&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>And you know you have good business process visualization. Then you drive to deliver those processes to that point and&nbsp;and&nbsp;it's. And again, if you do a good job and my team does a great job of&nbsp;of&nbsp;really articulating business process, you gain great efficiency and&nbsp;Moreover&nbsp;you get capacity to turn up the juice again, you can take more volume and you've&nbsp;you've&nbsp;articulated.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:05&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Nice.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:06&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>And really gotten the inefficiency out of the process, and&nbsp;Even&nbsp;so, you don't touch every transaction you touch the exceptions so you get a lot of leverage. But then you're correct if it's done right, if it's done.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:16&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Wrong, right? It maybe it's broken, maybe it falls off the table and somebody has to pick it up and has a manual step because they didn't think through it thoroughly. And&nbsp;and&nbsp;now you've got a bigger problem, right? And sometimes companies don't retire the old systems and they're working in two places, so there is a lot of&nbsp;negative&nbsp;that can come for people that don't manage and plan and&nbsp;and&nbsp;deliver these systems. And&nbsp;and&nbsp;again, we've been doing this.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:37&nbsp;<span>Chris</span>&nbsp;</p><p>For 27 years, so we're pretty&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;good at it so.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:38&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Will you?&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:40&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Wow.&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:42&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Well, you&nbsp;you&nbsp;mentioned Chris that you know when you were giving examples of the typical projects links&nbsp;that customers&nbsp;are&nbsp;are&nbsp;often migrating from other platforms. Other ERP&nbsp;ish. Perhaps they do some of the ERP work and then you're moving them into dynamics. And as you say.&nbsp;</p><p>00:14:02&nbsp;Andy&nbsp;</p><p>Once they get in there, they're going to be able to scale. It sounds like horizontally and&nbsp;and&nbsp;cover more territory than the system that they were using and also scale vertically. Like you said, turn up the juice and&nbsp;and&nbsp;just grow is that. Is that...]]></content:encoded>

About four inches here in FarmVille and then almost an inch of ice on top of that, which always makes it fun, right?</p><p>00:01:58 Frank</p><p>Yeah, the ice is worse than the snow on.</p><p>00:02:00 Frank</p><p>Basically so I went out, walk the dog today and one of the dogs and it was crunch, crunch, crunch.</p><p>00:02:06 Frank</p><p>So there's a nice layer of ice over everything which is going to make driving later fun, but I do have.</p><p>00:02:13 Frank</p><p>I do have the an all wheel drive car which is fantastic.</p><p>00:02:17 Frank</p><p>I will never not own one of those again.</p><p>00:02:19 Andy</p><p>Nice.</p><p>00:02:21 Frank</p><p>Yeah, you've seen it's the CRV.</p><p>00:02:23 Andy</p><p>Yes, yeah, it's nice you did well.</p><p>00:02:26 Frank</p><p>I dubbed it the Rocinante.</p><p>00:02:31 Andy</p><p>In case our listeners are not familiar with that, with what Frank is referring to, it is not the old novel.</p><p>00:02:40 Andy</p><p>Frank is not tilting at windmills instead.</p><p>00:02:44 Andy</p><p>And if I got that reference wrong, correct me.</p><p>00:02:46 Andy</p><p>I'll just edit that out.</p><p>00:02:47 Frank</p><p>Oh, you are right, it's from this AM Oh my God, I forgot new book on Cody.</p><p>00:02:48 Andy</p><p>Not sure.</p><p>00:02:51 Andy</p><p>Donkey Quixoti wasn't.</p><p>00:02:53 Frank</p><p>Yeah yeah Cervantes I was gonna say from Cervantes book and I'm like oh what was the name of that?</p><p>00:02:53 Andy</p><p>Yeah so.</p><p>00:02:59 Frank</p><p>Which is the opposite of how most people think, but that's what I do.</p><p>00:02:59 Frank</p><p>OK, good.</p><p>00:03:02 Andy</p><p>There we go, but it is actually a reference to both the books and a series, The expanse of which Frank and I are great fans, so.</p><p>00:03:12 Frank</p><p>Awesome, but you know who's not covered in snow today.</p><p>00:03:13 Andy</p><p>I like it.</p><p>00:03:15 Andy</p><p>Who is not covered in snow their guest.</p><p>00:03:16 Andy</p><p>Our guest.</p><p>00:03:18 Frank</p><p>Who lives in?</p><p>00:03:18 Frank</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>00:03:20 Frank</p><p>I'm assuming sunny or Smokey I guess depending on the time of year California Peter Voss Peter welcome to the show.</p><p>00:03:29 Peter Voss</p><p>Thank you, yes, it's we've got snow on the mountains here, but it's very sunny.</p><p>00:03:36 Peter Voss</p><p>It's it's nice and we have a lot less smog these days.</p><p>00:03:41 Andy</p><p>Very good.</p><p>00:03:41 Frank</p><p>Nice so you are the.</p><p>00:03:46 Frank</p><p>One of the world's, or if not the world's foremost authority in AGI or artificially artificial general intelligence, and I believe you are the one that coined the term.</p><p>00:03:58 Peter Voss</p><p>Yes, correct and 2001 myself and two other people. We coined the term artificial general intelligence AGI to really distinguish the kind of work we were doing from, you know, specialized narrow AI which is.</p><p>00:04:18 Peter Voss</p><p>Pretty much what everybody else is doing.</p><p>00:04:20 Peter Voss</p><p>The original dream of artificial intelligence was of course, to have systems that can think and learn the way humans do, but that turned out to be a lot lot harder than people thought.</p><p>00:04:31 Peter Voss</p><p>So over the years, AI really turned into narrow AI using human ingenuity to figure out how to solve one particular problem, like playing chess or.</p><p>00:04:41 Peter Voss</p><p>Container optimization or medical diagnosis and then to write a program or to train data to do that to solve that particular problem.</p><p>00:04:51 Peter Voss</p><p>But it's really the external intelligence of the program or the data scientists that is then encoded.</p><p>00:04:58 Peter Voss</p><p>To solve that problem, whereas we wanted to get back to the original dream of having a thinking machine that it can figure out how to do these things and and learn more humans do so.</p><p>00:05:09 Peter Voss</p><p>That's why we felt we had to.</p><p>00:05:12 Peter Voss</p><p>You know, coin a separate term to distinguish it from narrow AI.</p><p>00:05:16 Frank</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>00:05:18 Frank</p><p>So for years, AGI has been.</p><p>00:05:21 Frank</p><p>Kind of thought the stuff of science fiction.</p><p>00:05:24 Frank</p><p>I think there was a lot of optimistic people like you said that thought we would have it by now.</p><p>00:05:29 Frank</p><p>I know this is kind of a loaded question, but one do you think we'll ever get there and two, what's the sort of time frame we're looking at?</p><p>00:05:38 Peter Voss</p><p>Yes, it's an interesting question, so absolutely, I believe it's it's.</p><p>00:05:42 Peter Voss</p><p>Possible, and in fact the reason we got together. We wrote a book called Artificial General Intelligence. As I said in 2001 was because we believe the time is ripe to get back to this original dream that the technology had advanced enough. Both hardware and software technology and cognitive psychology. Cognitive science.</p><p>00:06:02 Peter Voss</p><p>That we now understood enough and had fundamentally had the tools in place to tackle this problem and to say.</p><p>00:06:11 Peter Voss</p><p>So I I absolutely believe that it can be solved soon, and in fact we will leave.</p><p>00:06:18 Peter Voss</p><p>We are on on the way of solving this problem now in terms of time frame.</p><p>00:06:24 Peter Voss</p><p>Normally the way I answer this question is I don't measure it in time.</p><p>00:06:28 Peter Voss</p><p>I measured in dollars.</p><p>00:06:31 Frank</p><p>I like that time is money, so I guess.</p><p>00:06:34 Frank</p><p>That's a reasonable correlation.</p><p>00:06:35 Peter Voss</p><p>Yeah, and and the reason I do, I say that is because.</p><p>00:06:39 Peter Voss</p><p>Still, today almost nobody is working on AGI. You know, 99% of all the effort in artificial intelligence is still on narrow AI, so if this continues, it will take a long long time for us to reach human level AGI. But if that changes.</p><p>00:07:00 Peter Voss</p><p>And you know the kind of funding that's going into deep learning machine learning suddenly was applied to AGI.</p><p>00:07:06 Peter Voss</p><p>Then I think it could easily happen at less than 10.</p><p>00:07:09 BAILeY</p><p>Yes.</p><p>00:07:10 Frank</p><p>Oh wow.</p><p>00:07:11 Andy</p><p>Very cool, so I'm curious is there any like lead in does?</p><p>00:07:16 Andy</p><p>Does time and money invested in deep learning and narrow AI?</p><p>00:07:23 Andy</p><p>Does any of that help move the cost?</p><p>00:07:25 Andy</p><p>Say further the cause for AGI?</p><p>00:07:29 Peter Voss</p><p>Slightly, I believe, you know.</p><p>00:07:32 Peter Voss</p><p>Obviously, any advances in languages and data collection in hardware development and the general experience.</p><p>00:07:42 Peter Voss</p><p>In that sense, it does help it.</p><p>00:07:44 Peter Voss</p><p>But in another sense, it's actually the opposite.</p><p>00:07:46 Peter Voss</p><p>It's actually hindering it because a whole generation of software engineers and data scientists are now coming into the field, believing that deep learning machine learning is a way to do it.</p><p>00:08:00 Peter Voss</p><p>And all we need is more data, more horsepower and will solve this problem.</p><p>00:08:05 Peter Voss</p><p>And that's I think barking up the wrong tree, and it's a it's a dead end.</p><p>00:08:10 Peter Voss</p><p>So in that sense, what's happening today with deep learning?</p><p>00:08:12 Peter Voss</p><p>Machine learning is actually counter to achieving.</p><p>00:08:16 Andy</p><p>GI interesting very interesting.</p><p>00:08:20 Frank</p><p>Was it always that way or it's just the way the market kind of went frenzied over just narrowed AI?</p><p>00:08:26 Peter Voss</p><p>Why?</p><p>00:08:26 Peter Voss</p><p>Well, we've had several windows of AI.</p><p>00:08:30 Peter Voss</p><p>You know the the disappointments over the decades.</p><p>00:08:33 Peter Voss</p><p>You know, when we had expert systems, people believe that you know they would really, you know, show real intelligence and then it kind of fizzled out.</p><p>00:08:42 Peter Voss</p><p>And so we've had.</p><p>00:08:43 Peter Voss</p><p>We've had various windows, and but of course, deep learning machine learning has been so spectacularly successful in several areas.</p><p>00:08:52 Peter Voss</p><p>You know, image recognition, improving speech recognition, and you know various other fields that just, you know, it's the only game in town as it has been very, very successful.</p><p>00:09:04 Peter Voss</p><p>But people are also starting to realize what the limitations are of it.</p><p>00:09:11 Peter Voss</p><p>So yeah, it's it's kind of at the moment.</p><p>00:09:14 Peter Voss</p><p>The only game in town, and it has really been successful in many.</p><p>00:09:17 Andy</p><p>Areas, So what are those limitations?</p><p>00:09:20 Andy</p><p>And how does AGI addressing?</p><p>00:09:23 Peter Voss</p><p>Yeah, so fundamentally when you think about intelligence, you know if you think about just common sense.</p><p>00:09:32 Peter Voss</p><p>If we talk to a person and we judge them to be intelligent or to be totally non intelligent, the kind of things we expect is that they can learn.</p><p>00:09:43 Peter Voss</p><p>Immediately that when you say something a, they understand what you're saying and they integrate that knowledge with their existing knowledge so you know if you say my sister's moving through Seattle next week or something.</p><p>00:10:01 Peter Voss</p><p>That knowledge needs to fit in somewhere.</p><p>00:10:04 Peter Voss</p><p>You know you know the person who's talking.</p><p>00:10:06 Peter Voss</p><p>You may know who the sister is, or you may not know who the sister is.</p><p>00:10:10 Peter Voss</p><p>You probably know what Seattle is.</p><p>00:10:13 Peter Voss</p><p>You may have images of, you know, rain pouring down all the time or whatever, but so you integrate that knowledge.</p><p>00:10:21 Peter Voss</p><p>And if you're not cleared, my maybe the person has two sisters, so then you would ask her, do you mean your older sister you know your younger sister?</p><p>00:10:30 Peter Voss</p><p>And so we expect an intelligent human to basically do.</p><p>00:10:35 Peter Voss</p><p>You know what's technically called one shot?</p><p>00:10:37 Peter Voss</p><p>Learning?</p><p>00:10:38 Peter Voss</p><p>You hear something once you see an image.</p><p>00:10:40 Peter Voss</p><p>Once you learn that and you integrate it into your existing knowledge base.</p><p>00:10:46 Peter Voss</p><p>And if you're not sure how to interpret it.</p><p>00:10:49 Peter Voss</p><p>Then you ask clarifying.</p><p>00:10:50 Peter Voss</p><p>Questions until you know what it what it is.</p><p>00:10:54 Peter Voss</p><p>So you have deep understanding you have disambiguation.</p><p>00:10:59 Peter Voss</p><p>You have learning instant learning, one shot learning.</p><p>00:11:03 Peter Voss</p><p>You have long term memory.</p><p>00:11:05 Peter Voss</p><p>You remember that next week you you know if you paid attention, you will remember that and you have reasoning about.</p><p>00:11:12 Peter Voss</p><p>30 now deep learning machine learning as it's done today, really doesn't offer any of those.</p><p>00:11:20 Peter Voss</p><p>So if you if you had a human and you told them something and they didn't remember it, they didn't understand that they didn't ask for clarification.</p><p>00:11:27 Peter Voss</p><p>You wouldn't think of them as being very intelligent, would you?</p><p>00:11:33 Frank</p><p>No, I mean, my kids are smart, but when I tell them to bring the trash cans back from the street, they'll conveniently forget.</p><p>00:11:39 Frank</p><p>But I, I think I know where you're going with that, yes?</p><p>00:11:42 BAILeY</p><p>All right?</p><p>00:11:44 Frank</p><p>But the question I have, it sounds like you're trying to and I know this is going to be not really good analogy.</p><p>00:11:50 Frank</p><p>Or maybe it is you're trying to code for curiosity.</p><p>00:11:54 Peter Voss</p><p>That's very much part of it, but you know even deeper is understanding.</p><p>00:11:59 Peter Voss</p><p>Basically, when you have some input, do you?</p><p>00:12:02 Peter Voss</p><p>Do you understand you know what the implications are, how it fits in with the rest of the knowledge that you have?</p><p>00:12:08 Peter Voss</p><p>And you know, even that, that's sort of more even more fundamental than curiosity.</p><p>00:12:13 Peter Voss</p><p>But yeah, curiosity is then wanting to gather more information, so this is inherently an interactive process.</p><p>00:12:22 Peter Voss</p><p>You know, an intelligent person would ask follow up questions you know they would want to kind of.</p><p>00:12:29 Peter Voss</p><p>Fill in the pieces of the puzzle and you know that they can be more.</p><p>00:12:33 Peter Voss</p><p>In fact effective in their communication on their or their job.</p><p>00:12:37 Frank</p><p>Right so.</p><p>00:12:37 Peter Voss</p><p>So yes, that's definitely part of it.</p><p>00:12:40 Frank</p><p>So calling back to your example of someone's sister moving to Seattle you you would ask, you know, I didn't know you had a sister or how many sisters do you have or how many siblings do you have and.</p><p>00:12:51 Frank</p><p>Where is she moving to?</p><p>00:12:52 Frank</p><p>Why?</p><p>00:12:53 Frank</p><p>I guess that's kind of.</p><p>00:12:55 Frank</p><p>I guess it's all about building that knowledge map inside.</p><p>00:12:58 Frank</p><p>Your head or then your head being could be a program I guess.</p><p>00:12:58 BAILeY</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>00:12:59 BAILeY</p><p>OK.</p><p>00:13:02 Peter Voss</p><p>Yeah, and deep learning machine learning really doesn't allow for that at all.</p><p>00:13:07 Peter Voss</p><p>You know you accumulate masses of data and you train a model, but that model is then static.</p><p>00:13:14 Peter Voss</p><p>It's a read only model.</p><p>00:13:15 Peter Voss</p><p>You know, it doesn't dynamically learn, so it may have a sort of a knowledge graph, but even that knowledge graph is.</p><p>00:13:23 Peter Voss</p><p>Is very opaque, it's.</p><p>00:13:26 Peter Voss</p><p>Yeah, it's not scrutable you know and and this is this is such a big problem with deep learning machine learning that you don't know why it gives a certain response, which is a huge...]]></content:encoded>

It was all in VB back then, Visual Basic. And so I wrote it that way in 2017 and for the 2nd edition I went back and updated all of that. That's really the only thing I changed was I went to C sharp.</p><p>00:03:06 Andy</p><p>An I kind of needed to because the rest of the book was going to be in C sharp anyway.</p><p>00:03:12 Andy</p><p>And so yeah, that's that's kind of how it went.</p><p>00:03:15 Andy</p><p>And for anybody listen, it thinks wow, Andy is smart.</p><p>00:03:18 Andy</p><p>He's written a book about C sharp.</p><p>00:03:20 Andy</p><p>He must know C sharp really, really well.</p><p>00:03:22 Andy</p><p>I say throughout the book I am not a C sharp developer.</p><p>00:03:26 Andy</p><p>I feel like I'm working my way up to being a noob, but but.</p><p>00:03:29 Frank</p><p>Don't you work classes?</p><p>00:03:31 Andy</p><p>I do wear glasses.</p><p>00:03:33 Andy</p><p>Yes, yeah.</p><p>00:03:33 Frank</p><p>So you can see sharp.</p><p>00:03:36 Andy</p><p>I did.</p><p>00:03:36 Andy</p><p>They took me awhile.</p><p>00:03:37 Andy</p><p>Do you have your sound effects running from I?</p><p>00:03:39 Frank</p><p>Do were back in Zend Caster.</p><p>00:03:41 Frank</p><p>So for folks listening like I don't remember this being on the live stream.</p><p>00:03:45 Frank</p><p>If it's not, we're doing this the old fashioned way right then, and don't worry, Andy and I've been live streaming a lot, which you probably noticed, but today we have a very special guest, don't we, Andy?</p><p>00:03:48 Frank</p><p>Um?</p><p>00:03:56 Andy</p><p>Yeah yeah, Dan Burke all is awesome.</p><p>00:04:00 Andy</p><p>He's a co-founder and CEO and I hope I say this right, is it?</p><p>00:04:04 Andy</p><p>Is it nami? Nami ML Dan.</p><p>00:04:07 Dan Burcaw</p><p>Yeah nami. Like tsunami.</p><p>00:04:09 Andy</p><p>Ah OK, I got it right the first time NAMI AML and it's a really smart service for monetizing digital products with subscriptions.</p><p>00:04:09 Frank</p><p>Well.</p><p>00:04:19 Andy</p><p>And just he's had a whole ton of experience working in, you know, in marketing for the Oracle Marketing Cloud, working with the mobile product for that.</p><p>00:04:31 Andy</p><p>So pretty smart Guy joined joined Oracle back during the acquisition of Push IO and.</p><p>00:04:39 Andy</p><p>Push IO was a leading mobile messaging provider as well.</p><p>00:04:44 Andy</p><p>And he served there as a Co founder and CEO.</p><p>00:04:47 Andy</p><p>There's a bunch more in here about Nan, an it all kind of boils down to super smart, successful guy.</p><p>00:04:54 Andy</p><p>We've had a little bit of banner before we click the record button an I can attest to.</p><p>00:04:59 Andy</p><p>That is really enjoyable conversation.</p><p>00:05:01 Andy</p><p>I look forward to this show.</p><p>00:05:02 Andy</p><p>Thanks for being here, Dan.</p><p>00:05:05 Speaker 1</p><p>Really happy to be here.</p><p>00:05:05 Speaker 1</p><p>Really happy to be here.</p><p>00:05:06 Speaker 1</p><p>Thanks for having me.</p><p>00:05:07 Frank</p><p>Awesome, so you're a serial entrepreneur and you founded a bunch of companies.</p><p>00:05:13 Frank</p><p>Um, but my favorite part of the bio I read on you was that.</p><p>00:05:18 Frank</p><p>You wrote software that ended up on a nuclear submarine.</p><p>00:05:23 Speaker 1</p><p>Yeah, that's right.</p><p>00:05:26 Speaker 1</p><p>It's it's hard.</p><p>00:05:26 Frank</p><p>That that totally away I was like what?</p><p>00:05:29 Speaker 1</p><p>It it's it's hard to even tell that story sometimes because it's so unbelievable.</p><p>00:05:35 Speaker 1</p><p>I 17 years old at the time.</p><p>00:05:38 Speaker 1</p><p>The company that I cofounded was building a flavor of Linux.</p><p>00:05:46 Speaker 1</p><p>A flavor of Linux that was designed to run on Apple Macintosh hardware.</p><p>00:05:52 Speaker 1</p><p>And at the time.</p><p>00:05:52 Frank</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>00:05:54 Speaker 1</p><p>Then the the reason for that was that Apple was using the power PC chip power PC chip in that moment of time. You know, we're kind of talking in the late 90s. Early 2000s had fantastic price per performance per Watt, which is a metric that a lot of folks in the kind of high performance computing world look at when they're trying to figure out.</p><p>00:06:11 Andy</p><p>Me.</p><p>00:06:18 Speaker 1</p><p>How to build these kind of supercomputer clusters?</p><p>00:06:21 Speaker 1</p><p>And so it just happened at that moment in time, the Mac would had had the best price performance per Watt because of the chips that they.</p><p>00:06:29 Speaker 1</p><p>We're using and so we we ended up doing a deal with Lockheed Martin and the US Navy to build a cluster of Macs running Linux.</p><p>00:06:45 Speaker 1</p><p>That were deployed across the US Navy nuclear sub fleet for the purpose of doing sonar image processing, yeah.</p><p>00:06:53 Andy</p><p>Wow.</p><p>00:06:55 Speaker 1</p><p>The the the software that I wrote was related to.</p><p>00:07:00 Speaker 1</p><p>You know how folks on the boat would have to manage these units if there was issues, how would you know?</p><p>00:07:07 Speaker 1</p><p>Kind of the maintainability repair ability was a big issue when you're actually out at sea and trying to have this stuff run in kind of a mission critical fashion so.</p><p>00:07:17 Speaker 1</p><p>We ended up.</p><p>00:07:17 Speaker 1</p><p>I mean it was this was such a crazy project because the hardware was modified hardware.</p><p>00:07:22 Speaker 1</p><p>It wasn't off the shelf Apple hardware, it was Apple Hardware and then we did a bunch of things to it and then it was Linux and then it was some custom software that made the whole thing operate an.</p><p>00:07:35 Speaker 1</p><p>So it's it was.</p><p>00:07:37 Speaker 1</p><p>It was a nutty project, an I'm.</p><p>00:07:40 Speaker 1</p><p>Looking back on it now, I'm surprised that it had ever shipped quite frankly.</p><p>00:07:46 Frank</p><p>Spoken like a true engineer, right?</p><p>00:07:48 Frank</p><p>You're always you always look at your flaws and like Oh my God, that's actually running.</p><p>00:07:56 Frank</p><p>So so you you where did you go after that?</p><p>00:08:00 Frank</p><p>'cause it says you know you're a serial entrepreneur and so how did you get into?</p><p>00:08:05 Frank</p><p>I don't want to steal.</p><p>00:08:06 Frank</p><p>Kind of our pre canned questions Thunder but.</p><p>00:08:11 Frank</p><p>Tell me how did you get into A&amp;ML? Or were you doing ML on those on those retrofitted Max?</p><p>00:08:18 Speaker 1</p><p>No, we weren't.</p><p>00:08:19 Speaker 1</p><p>We weren't, but but you know, I think that part of the hype that world of high performance computing where a lot of our customers were, you know, national labs or defense oriented things.</p><p>00:08:30 Speaker 1</p><p>I mean, part of the appeal of what we were offering in that period of time was that they were running algorithms an doing some of this stuff.</p><p>00:08:39 Speaker 1</p><p>You know, obviously ahead ahead ahead of their time and they need it.</p><p>00:08:43 Speaker 1</p><p>There wasn't the cloud computing yet, so they were literally just trying to assemble the biggest.</p><p>00:08:49 Speaker 1</p><p>Supercomputers using off the shelf hardware that they possibly could so we weren't writing the algorithms.</p><p>00:08:55 Speaker 1</p><p>We were more enabling these algorithms to be run, but I would say the Fast forward is that in terms of my career, is that working on that led to?</p><p>00:09:09 Speaker 1</p><p>Being involved in sort of the mobile ecosystem from the launch of the App Store and the iPhone back in 2000, seven 2008 and in a way it was very very similar to what we did with the submarines. Because you were dealing with constrained hard.</p><p>00:09:25 Speaker 1</p><p>Where you always had to care about performance and battery life and battery life, less so on the Subs.</p><p>00:09:31 Speaker 1</p><p>But some of the same sort of constraints where you're trying to get the best performance you can out of these things and operating in that mobile landscape and building apps for some of the largest consumer brands.</p><p>00:09:46 Speaker 1</p><p>And then you guys mentioned in the in the intro about push IO.</p><p>00:09:49 Speaker 1</p><p>This mobile messaging company that we.</p><p>00:09:51 Speaker 1</p><p>Built, we ended up at Oracle building this mobile marketing engine is part of the Oracle Marketing Cloud an and one of the things that we saw there is that now.</p><p>00:10:03 Speaker 1</p><p>Fast forward to kind of more modern times and there's such a prevalent use out there of.</p><p>00:10:11 Speaker 1</p><p>Technology like email, you know email marketing systems and push notifications in the world of mobile in order to tackle kind of a fundamental problem that exists with some of these products, which is the user.</p><p>00:10:28 Speaker 1</p><p>Download your app, let's say, and they use it and then and then they churn, and then they abandon an and you as a publisher of a product like this, is one of the battles that you're trying to fight is how do I get them back into the experience and so are sort of observation is we were.</p><p>00:10:44 Andy</p><p>Right?</p><p>00:10:48 Speaker 1</p><p>You know, done our tenure there and we're looking to do something next.</p><p>00:10:52 Speaker 1</p><p>And new was a couple of things.</p><p>00:10:55 Speaker 1</p><p>The first thing we saw was that with the iPhone 10, I think it was.</p><p>00:11:01 Speaker 1</p><p>Apple released.</p><p>00:11:02 Speaker 1</p><p>Face ID.</p><p>00:11:03 Speaker 1</p><p>And that was using algorithms running on the device, so the benefit was you could unlock the phone very, very fast, but also it had some privacy characteristics where Apple doesn't need your face and the kind of the point cloud representation of your face to be up on their servers somewhere.</p><p>00:11:21 Speaker 1</p><p>That was really intriguing to us.</p><p>00:11:23 Speaker 1</p><p>The other thing was that we saw that the app economy, so to speak, was in transition from kind of the early days of where it was paid downloads.</p><p>00:11:33 Speaker 1</p><p>Transitioning to kind of in app purchases, which the game ecosystem has really been been focused on to trying to create more durable, sustainable revenue models through subscription.</p><p>00:11:35 Speaker 1</p><p>Which is right?</p><p>00:11:46 Speaker 1</p><p>And so how we sort of arrived at focusing a lot on data at NAMI.</p><p>00:11:53 Speaker 1</p><p>Is that it?</p><p>00:11:54 Speaker 1</p><p>It seemed to us like there was.</p><p>00:11:56 Speaker 1</p><p>If we we would, we really were excited about an idea that if we could.</p><p>00:12:02 Speaker 1</p><p>Help the guy.</p><p>00:12:04 Speaker 1</p><p>Is.</p><p>00:12:04 Speaker 1</p><p>App publishers a mechanism to send way fewer push notifications.</p><p>00:12:10 Speaker 1</p><p>An email messages because they had a technology stack that could allow them to detect in the experience, right directly on the device that somebody was showing signs of churn, or that somebody was showing some.</p><p>00:12:25 Speaker 1</p><p>Early intent that they might be a a candidate to be a subscriber, and so just that idea that maybe there's a way that we could be part of cutting down the messaging load by making the actual experiences smarter and more intelligent about what users are doing was where we.</p><p>00:12:42 Speaker 1</p><p>Started.</p><p>00:12:43 Frank</p><p>That's interesting.</p><p>00:12:43 Frank</p><p>That's it.</p><p>00:12:44 Frank</p><p>What sorts of signals?</p><p>00:12:47 Frank</p><p>That you can collect given specially with Apple's kind of enhanced privacy policies that they've been been doing.</p><p>00:12:55 Frank</p><p>An what?</p><p>00:12:56 Frank</p><p>What sorts of signals kind of indicate churn?</p><p>00:13:00 Speaker 1</p><p>So you know it is.</p><p>00:13:01 Speaker 1</p><p>It's a great question.</p><p>00:13:02 Speaker 1</p><p>When we started out we were thing.</p><p>00:13:04 Speaker 1</p><p>Gain, we're going to collect all this crazy stuff.</p><p>00:13:07 Speaker 1</p><p>I mean, we were even thinking at one point in the early prototyping that you know, maybe maybe, what carrier the user is on is some signal.</p><p>00:13:16 Speaker 1</p><p>Maybe the device form factor, whether it's the really expensive version of the phone or the lower you know there's all these things that we were thinking about, but.</p><p>00:13:24 Speaker 1</p><p>When when?</p><p>00:13:27 Speaker 1</p><p>And we're not my cofounder and I are not experts in this field, so one of the things that we did was we recruited our CTO who has a PhD in applied math and had been building data science animal models, kind of in production at, you know, in the real world.</p><p>00:13:46 Speaker 1</p><p>Applications of places like the Los Angeles Times and Tribune Publishing and one of the first things he told us when he came in was guys like, wait, you're trying to?</p><p>00:13:55 Speaker 1</p><p>You don't need all these days.</p><p>00:13:56 Speaker 1</p><p>Points a lot of what you're trying to collect just isn't isn't going to move the needle, and So what.</p><p>00:13:57 Speaker 1</p><p>Huh?</p><p>00:14:03 Speaker 1</p><p>It really gets to both on the so we look at, you know from subscriptions we're looking at.</p><p>00:14:07 Speaker 1</p><p>Kind of two things.</p><p>00:14:08 Speaker 1</p><p>One is what are signals that show that somebody might be have a propensity to purchase.</p><p>00:14:17 Speaker 1</p><p>And then, secondarily, that early turn detection, or kind of likelihood to churn.</p><p>00:14:23 Speaker 1</p><p>And it turns out it's it's pretty simple on some level, because it's really about the behavioral signals around engagement.</p><p>00:14:34 Frank</p><p>Interesting soon.</p><p>00:14:34 Speaker 1</p><p>So are they using the app or are they using the app a lot?</p><p>00:14:38 Speaker 1</p><p>Or they did they used to use it a lot and now they're not using it as much so those are kind of the key?</p><p>00:14:44 Andy</p><p>Signals, so you're not popping up little boxes and saying, do you want to keep using the app?</p><p>00:14:51 Andy</p><p>Check yes or no.</p><p>00:14:54 Speaker 1</p><p>No, I mean it's it's.</p><p>00:14:55 Speaker 1</p><p>It's funny, you know.</p><p>00:14:57 Speaker 1</p><p>I have a friend that has that has a

this.</p><p>00:15:06 Speaker 1</p><p>Yep, and you know they have a really fascinating take on it, which is that.</p><p>00:15:11 Speaker 1</p><p>Because whenever I see one of those, I hit no, I don't.</p><p>00:15:14 Speaker 1</p><p>I you know, I just like want to dismiss it an.</p><p>00:15:17 Andy</p><p>Yeah, yeah.</p><p>00:15:18 Speaker 1</p><p>Yeah, he's got a strong viewpoint that by by asking a user a binary question it provides them better data for what they're trying to do around kind of customer sentiment an so I just thought I was fascinated by that because whenever I see one of

Right&nbsp;now&nbsp;we call her Bailey which is an acronym for British AI Lady. You can look in the transcripts. You'll see her kind of listed as there is a name.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">00:02:23 Frank</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">Interestingly enough, we&nbsp;changed up how we do our transcripts. I used to use video indexer but now word online you can&nbsp;actually upload&nbsp;the audio file, the MP3 file and it will&nbsp;actually not&nbsp;only do the transcription and the timestamp, but&nbsp;actually the&nbsp;speaker identification too.&nbsp;So&nbsp;we&nbsp;actually test&nbsp;this out.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">00:02:45 Frank</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">And it's&nbsp;pretty accurate, so you'll so hopefully now are.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">00:02:52 Frank</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">Hopefully now are.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">00:02:55 Frank</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">Our transcripts are much more accessible. That's something we've been meaning to do and.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">00:03:01 Frank</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">Yeah, oh, I see Andy's on hey what's up? Andy&nbsp;yeah&nbsp;we I shared that email with you and yeah, we are we're&nbsp;we're&nbsp;we're&nbsp;reaching the top 30 this is pretty good I'm&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;excited I'm happy about the show. Happy I'm thankful&nbsp;Thanksgiving&nbsp;right?</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">00:03:18 Frank</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">So&nbsp;I'm thankful for having Andy as a good friend and a cohost on this journey on this epic road trip down the information superhighway. As we say in our standard intro&nbsp;and&nbsp;but he was basically talking about all the things that look very futuristic in those commercials and.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">00:03:39 Frank</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">The my&nbsp;dog is about to pull my arm off. I can feel it.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">00:03:43 Frank</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">And.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">00:03:46 Frank</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">So.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">00:03:47 Frank</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">Yeah, so it's interesting that how&nbsp;how&nbsp;that you know.&nbsp;So&nbsp;he kind of goes through. It's interesting from a language point of view,&nbsp;'cause&nbsp;I was alive in 1993. I was in the middle of college and all that stuff seemed I wouldn't say in pop.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">00:04:00 Frank</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">Possible seems a little&nbsp;far fetched&nbsp;in a little improbable, but it's interesting how that video predicted touch screens. The widespread use of touch screens so it held up&nbsp;pretty well, except for the fact it wasn't really a T&amp;T that was a major player in that, and if memory serves the AT&amp;T&nbsp;we know today is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;rebranding of singular, which was another company entirely so.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">00:04:24 Frank</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">I'm sure someone will call me on the comments if I'm wrong.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">00:04:28 Frank</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">But just&nbsp;wanna&nbsp;say I love you too man.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">00:04:32 Frank</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit">See Andy's comment.

She came to my office door with her codon and I said, well, why do you have your code on and she said, oh I'm going to get that stuff you need and I said well, what stuff are you talking about? And she said this stuff, we were just messaging back and forth about. I said I was. I've been sitting here at my office just doing work I didn't.</p><p>00:03:28 Dana</p><p>Message you about anything.</p><p>00:03:30 Dana</p><p>So then she showed me and they they person initially sent an email that looked like it was kind of from my email very similar, which is always usually what they do. And then you know the urgency factor. I always tell people when there's a sense of urgency. We have to stop and say, is this really a big big emergency here to go buy gift cards? But people want to please their boss so they get these emails and they act upon them.</p><p>00:03:50 Dana</p><p>So she then then the person said, can you give me your email? I mean your cell phone. I wanted to text you this. So then the conversation jumped over to her cell phone and now they're texting back and forth and she said, well, how am I going to pay for these?</p><p>00:04:02 Dana</p><p>And then he said, well, you know what? Just when you get to the store, read off the numbers in the back of the card and then when you get back I'll reimburse you. So they were. I mean, it was just back and forth and back, but anybody would have fallen for this anybody.</p><p>00:04:13 Frank</p><p>Wow, the thing that struck me is the most insidious part.</p><p>00:04:17 Frank</p><p>It's how they moved away from email pretty early in the process, because maybe I mean it was a good. I mean, there's a I don't know. As a data scientist, I I hate giving out statistics, but let's say it was a 5050 chance that that person had your cell.</p><p>00:04:30 Frank</p><p>Phone number.</p><p>00:04:31 Frank</p><p>Millimeter like an an. It's a good gambit for them because I guess they didn't have your number already saved in their phone, so they could have this whole conversation with you, right? Yeah, an I would assume that folks in your organization are well trained.</p><p>00:04:46 Dana</p><p>Well, we're at least talking about this stuff right times. That's that's a startling factor, is that?</p><p>00:04:52 Dana</p><p>You know we're talking about all these things all the time and we we totally almost fell for it so.</p><p>00:04:57 Frank</p><p>Well, I never disclosed this publicly.</p><p>00:05:00 Frank</p><p>Until I'll do it now is that one time Microsoft? I work for Microsoft, they they pay the mortgage, they pay for the electricity and it goes through the my little monitor display there.</p><p>00:05:12 Frank</p><p>But they will routinely send out kind of phishing emails.</p><p>00:05:16 Frank</p><p>And it will be like urgent you have to, like, you know, do this because your expense report or something like this. And I shouldn't admit this publicly, but I did I was driving. I see this like emergency thing come through. I'm like the screen and I'm like.</p><p>00:05:30 Frank</p><p>So I didn't think I clicked on it and it it got it. It it it got a there was there was there should have been an animated GIF of like somebody?</p><p>00:05:38 Frank</p><p>At the company doing this, but it was like this. It was this like badge of shame of like hey you fell for this uh huh.</p><p>00:05:45 Frank</p><p>You know, and I was like crap and I was like I learned. 2 lessons one.</p><p>00:05:51 Frank</p><p>Pull over first.</p><p>00:05:53 Frank</p><p>If I can't mouse over the link.</p><p>00:05:56 Frank</p><p>Probably shouldn't click on it, right?</p><p>00:05:58 Frank</p><p>And three is just.</p><p>00:06:00 Frank</p><p>That sense of urgency.</p><p>00:06:01 Frank</p><p>Um was what really like, and maybe there's a psychological thing to this where it just tricks off like this. The primordial brain, or I know there's the three brain model and Andy and I go off on tangents a lot. Dan, I should warn you, but not us. Ultimately the idea is that once you're kind of anxious about something right, your higher brain functions are going, if not shut off kind of be pushed aside.</p><p>00:06:24 Frank</p><p>And all you have to do is click the link to get your answer or whatever I mean.</p><p>00:06:28 Frank</p><p>It seems like these folks are well versed in this type of psychology.</p><p>00:06:33 Dana</p><p>Yeah, and they also know too that you know every when you're on your mobile, everybody is rush rush rush rush rush for rushing on the mobile phone all the time and that is a little scary because sometimes even when you look on the mobile you can't even see who it's from. It'll it'll you know. Just say a name or something like even some of the Apple ones that come out. Don't say oh it's from Apple, but that's not the exact. Doesn't show you the phone number or whatever it is. It's just.</p><p>00:06:55 Dana</p><p>Summer has put up there. As you know The Who it's from kind of thing, so yeah.</p><p>00:07:00 Dana</p><p>There's a lot of things we need to all.</p><p>00:07:01 Dana</p><p>Start doing or not doing.</p><p>00:07:03 Frank</p><p>Right, it's it's an interesting. It's just fascinating that with all this advances in cybersecurity, and I've seen a lot of the things that the technical we're not going to go into.</p><p>00:07:14 Frank</p><p>Humans are like the weak link.</p><p>00:07:16 Dana</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>00:07:18 Frank</p><p>That's crazy.</p><p>00:07:20 Dana</p><p>Yeah, definitely, and that's the frontline to most of the stuff and you know the urgency factor just to go back to that real quick one. Scam that that that is targeted at seniors.</p><p>00:07:29 Dana</p><p>Is the grandparent scam, and So what they do is they will call up and pretend that there's someone's grandson or granddaughter and something crazy happened like there's held hostage in a Mexican jail or something and they need to have money right away wired to them so that they can, you know, get out of there. So then to make it even sound more valid, they put the prison guard on the phone and they say, you know who?</p><p>00:07:49 Dana</p><p>This is the information. This is where you need to send it to, and he's a very stern person and these people really do fall for this and a lot of the people Western unions around the country. They they know that this.</p><p>00:08:00 Dana</p><p>Time is running rampant, so they'll try to stop people. I did a speech to speech the other day or whatever. I talked the other day and they were about probably about 1000 people on there and nobody said anything when I brought this up. And then at the end when we had the Q&amp;A, there had to at least be 25 to 50 people. That said, my my mother fell for this and she would not believe that it wasn't my son. You know another one.</p><p>00:08:20 Dana</p><p>Edit There there there's a scam was that they said that their grandson was had drugs in the car and was with some guy that he was going fishing with and it was just one after the.</p><p>00:08:30 Dana</p><p>And a lot of the time that seniors won't even admit that this happens because they're embarrassed by it, and then they're afraid that their children, their adult children are not going to let them manage their finances. So again, it's a whole play. An urgency plan, emotion, and you're not even thinking straight. I mean, if somebody came up to you and said your grandson is in a Mexican jail right now.</p><p>00:08:50 Dana</p><p>And we need to give money. You do stop and think a little bit, but the way we act on line is very different than the way we act when we're here. We act on the phone when somebody calls, we want to believe them. Then we would act.</p><p>00:09:00 Dana</p><p>As if they were standing in front of us, so that's kind of some of the awareness that I like to to spread is safe. Just ask yourself if this person was standing here and this conversation was happening, would it sound crazy, you know?</p><p>00:09:11 Andy</p><p>So Dana, we talked a lot about the problem and how do we make ourselves shift gears like that? How do we engage, you know, Mentale in a way that maybe defeats the Sergeant.</p><p>00:09:25 Dana</p><p>Well, you know cybersecurity training has been, you know, going on over the years. The problem is getting bigger and bigger and bigger and we're throwing more and more money at it. And it's not getting any better, right? Yeah, so I say we need to approach it. I look at things a little bit differently, so usually it's the IT department that's responsible for putting together a program to teach the regular, non technical people.</p><p>00:09:46 Dana</p><p>You know?</p><p>00:09:46 Dana</p><p>What they need to do and not do so, they're forced to sit through an hours worth of training. They're about to fall asleep. All they want to do is be able to get through it so they can check off the box that they actually went. They did it, that's it, and I don't think that's the best way to teach people what I think we should do is we should start teaching them how they can protect themselves, their families, their homes. There's going to get some interests are going to say hey, you know that's.</p><p>00:10:10 Dana</p><p>I better call my mother and tell her to watch out for that, or I better make sure my son's not doing that and there's a there's a buy in there. So now once you get that buy in, there's an awareness that we need to start protecting things.</p><p>00:10:20 Dana</p><p>And then when you're talking about the at the company, you've already educated them on how they should be looking at their emails. Then now they know how that they need to be looking at the emails with the company, 'cause emails is pretty much where most of the problems are starting from, so so I just think it's if we looked at it a little bit differently, maybe we would be getting through to people a little bit different.</p><p>00:10:37 Andy</p><p>Well, I like your approach because we've already kind of walked through a lot of this, and we've said that it's not a technical issue at all, an.</p><p>00:10:45 Andy</p><p>Being a night person and Frank just Frank admitted earlier that were high functioning. You know, savants. Basically Frank and I were both 80 D and you know. And it's.</p><p>00:10:58 Frank</p><p>A normal account cards in Vegas though, which I totally feel shaded. I'm sorry, alright cut off, that's OK, it was funny.</p><p>00:11:06 Andy</p><p>Yeah, but you know it.</p><p>00:11:08 Andy</p><p>Having the app when you were just describing that I was imagining people that you know, even my you know my cellphone Frank doing this and we're like I said kind of high functioning but normal IT people and nothing against normal IT people I love you, I mean it but having them try to explain something nontechnical. 'cause if if we've identified that the issue is not really a technical.</p><p>00:11:31 Andy</p><p>Problem and we throw money at it and bought deer. Develop software that others have built and all of that really what's happening here is very psychological.</p><p>00:11:39 Andy</p><p>So I would. I would think that that that approach you just described having a non technical person walk through this, which sounds to me very emotional scenario that comes at you. You know on.</p><p>00:11:55 Andy</p><p>People you love an urgency and it's on your phone. And it's like every card that the scammers have is being played against. Especially older people who are not familiar but not as familiar with the technology as some of us.</p><p>00:12:08 Dana</p><p>Uh-huh absolutely absolutely. So I just think it's a different way to approach things and it it comes across as if you're giving the employee a benefit as opposed to forcing them to sit down because you need to protect the company.</p><p>00:12:20 Dana</p><p>Yeah OK, great.</p><p>00:12:21 Dana</p><p>So that's what I have to do, you know, kind of thing.</p><p>00:12:24 Andy</p><p>So we'll just envision mandatory training. Sorry, I just had a vision of office space of.</p><p>00:12:30 Andy</p><p>Well, you know, is this good for the company that banner?</p><p>00:12:33 Frank</p><p>Friday is Crazy shirt day.</p><p>00:12:39 Frank</p><p>There's a movie reference for the show, Andy, that could you?</p><p>00:12:45 Frank</p><p>I don't have my sound board.</p><p>00:12:46 Andy</p><p>You don't have your sound.</p><p>00:12:48 Frank</p><p>Now that's one of the disadvantages of switching to LinkedIn. Live will fix it. You know us where engineers Andy?</p><p>00:12:55 Frank</p><p>So the the question I guess is.</p><p>00:13:01 Frank</p><p>How do so? Yeah, I mean I think it was really insightful. Was you know my wife bought a bunch of studies of books to study for the CI, SSP and all that. And it's like a I mean, it's a it's a book and.</p><p>00:13:15 Frank</p><p>It's not technical, you're right. I mean, people are the weak link and I think.</p><p>00:13:20 Frank</p><p>People, and then that whole like you brought out the whole shame factor. Like I'm not going to admit like I mean that thing would happen to me. I got caught by our internal team, right? I was a year ago and I'm just admitting it now. Like you know. And and I did that on purpose because, well, I didn't hide it on purpose. Well, I guess I did, but I wanted to.</p><p>00:13:40 Frank</p><p>To point out is that there's not a lot of shame. I mean, the shame of this, I think is a big barrier, isn't it? To protection, isn't it?</p><p>00:13:47 Dana</p><p>Yeah, definitely it is. Yeah, we all have to get over that. Oh my goodness, I don't wanna be the one that you know.</p><p>00:13:51 Dana</p><p>Took the company down. I don't want to be the one that you know did this or let this in or what you know, whatever. Whatever the case may be, it's definitely a shame factor is is a big thing and and recognizing that the people are the biggest thing and one thing is that cyber security training, right? So it's going on a little bit here and there. The big companies much more so some of the smaller companies and medium size companies. There is nothing. It's like the Wild West going on out there so you know whatever you think your secretary is comfortable clicking on.</p><p>00:14:16 Dana</p><p>That's what she's clicking on.</p><p>00:14:17 Dana</p><p>So that's where we need to say, OK, this is a whole new industry and it's you know, it's it's it's it's. It's exploding right now and I think over the next three to five years cybersecurity training is going to be. It's going to be everywhere and everybody. Even the small companies are going to have to going to have to do something along those lines, but.</p><p>00:14:34 Dana</p><p>That being said, so because it's so new again, going back to the IT department, if you said to anybody five years ago, you know something about cybersecurity, they probably don't even really know what you're talking about. They say you need to talk to the IT department.</p><p>00:14:46 Dana</p><p>So we always just that pass up. Oh, that's a night thing we don't get involved in that. It's a night thing and like you we've all just been talking about it's not it's it's the people that IT thing might be perfect. You know maybe they have at the firewall or whatever all that stuff they need to do. But it's the people are just clicking on it, downloading things, you're going nowhere.</p><p>00:15:04 Frank</p><p>No, that's true. I mean, you can have the best firewall and all that packets like lock down to the teeth, but I mean if if somebody behind the firewall clicks on the.</p><p>00:15:13 Frank</p><p>Clicks on the link.</p><p>00:15:16 Frank</p><p>It's kind of like if you want to imagine like this is. This is the image I have is well, First off. I think the problem might be the term cyber security, right? 'cause when you hear the term cyber security I think of like somebody like with this type of monitor setup. You know like yeah right. You know like hacking away at the matrix or something like that like yeah.</p><p>00:15:35 Frank</p><p>No, it's not. It doesn't have to be. I mean, there's a....]]></content:encoded>

I do have an iPad, but it's not with me.</p><p>00:03:28 Andy</p><p>That's Frank, the 1st right.</p><p>00:03:30 Frank</p><p>Frank the 1st.</p><p>00:03:34 Frank</p><p>I rather like that I rather like that.</p><p>00:03:38 Frank</p><p>So the idea here is you know how do these things work.</p><p>00:03:41 Frank</p><p>You know what?</p><p>00:03:44 Frank</p><p>An you know, in terms of the guests and and kind of things and I know you have a A Time Constraint so I just want to kind of demonstrate something that I've had the chance for a work engagement had a chance to kind of study up on all three because it was a competitive situation between Louis.</p><p>00:04:03 Frank</p><p>Which is ultimately what powers Cortana, kind of behind the scenes, and Lex which is the Alexa version for processing text and dialogue flow, which is the Google version, so it's a lot of mouthfuls an I did. Let's see if we can get our guests to introduce themselves Alexa.</p><p>00:04:24 Frank</p><p>Hi how are you?</p><p>00:04:27 Speaker 3</p><p>I'm feeling like a home run.</p><p>00:04:29 Speaker 3</p><p>This weekend I'll be watching a lot of my favorite sports.</p><p>00:04:35 Frank</p><p>OK.</p><p>00:04:38 Frank</p><p>I'm getting a warning sign on my stream ability here, so I don't know what's going on.</p><p>00:04:42 Andy</p><p>What's up with that?</p><p>00:04:43 Frank</p><p>I don't know Well, you're still hear me so that's a good sign.</p><p>00:04:46 Andy</p><p>Yeah, you're you're good with me and I'm out here on the in the boondocks with 25 minutes bro.</p><p>00:04:50 Frank</p><p>There you go.</p><p>00:04:52 Frank</p><p>Hey Cortana.</p><p>00:04:54 Frank</p><p>How are you?</p><p>00:04:57 Speaker 4</p><p>Great thanks.</p><p>00:04:59 Frank</p><p>There you go.</p><p>00:05:00 Frank</p><p>And let's see what our friend Google Assistant.</p><p>00:05:03 Frank</p><p>Has to say.</p><p>00:05:10 Frank</p><p>Hey court, I'm sorry. OK Google, how are you?</p><p>00:05:18 Frank</p><p>Oops, it's on my Bluetooth, that's why OK.</p><p>00:05:22 Frank</p><p>You could tell where life looks 'cause it's just all bloopers.</p><p>00:05:27 Frank</p><p>How are you?</p><p>00:05:32 Frank</p><p>So we've returned a bunch of short search results, OK?</p><p>00:05:39 Frank</p><p>What's interesting about these three is that they're all trying to solve essentially the same problem, right? The they they are trying to solve.</p><p>00:05:46 Frank</p><p>The ability to take human language.</p><p>00:05:49 Frank</p><p>And type, it in and convert it to let me see if I get this screen back up.</p><p>00:05:55 Frank</p><p>An I will maximize that there we go see my fancy setup I do. It's cool, isn't it? Yes.</p><p>00:06:04 Frank</p><p>Alright, so ultimately they're all trying to say the same problem. Hey, we have a comment wise guy. Yes I am miserable. OK, alright, so here's the problem that all these devices want to solve, right? This is a human. This is some speaker device thingy.</p><p>00:06:21 Frank</p><p>Right?</p><p>00:06:23 Frank</p><p>And.</p><p>00:06:25 Frank</p><p>You have the cloud.</p><p>00:06:27 Frank</p><p>Which I think is really makes this.</p><p>00:06:29 Frank</p><p>Possible in a lot of ways or not. Just possible and practical? Yeah yeah.</p><p>00:06:34 Frank</p><p>I say.</p><p>00:06:36 Frank</p><p>You know, turn.</p><p>00:06:39 Frank</p><p>I have to be careful 'cause I actually do have the lights in my Home Office so.</p><p>00:06:43</p><p>Set up to this.</p><p>00:06:46 Frank</p><p>Right, right? So this gets digitized into audio.</p><p>00:06:51 Frank</p><p>Right?</p><p>00:06:52 Frank</p><p>Here right, I'll draw that by Squiggly Lines.</p><p>00:06:55 Andy</p><p>Right, I like to squiggly lines.</p><p>00:06:57 Frank</p><p>See, I'm talented, I'm very.</p><p>00:06:59 Andy</p><p>Hard you are. You're an artist.</p><p>00:07:01 Frank</p><p>Then a cloud service, right? Whether that's Louis.</p><p>00:07:07 Frank</p><p>Dialogflow</p><p>00:07:09 Frank</p><p>Or Lax.</p><p>00:07:12 Frank</p><p>Converts that into.</p><p>00:07:15 Frank</p><p>Back into text or into text, right? Right turn the.</p><p>00:07:20 Frank</p><p>Lights on.</p><p>00:07:27 Frank</p><p>Then what happens is then you have to figure out what does that mean. What's the context here, right? What's the intent? That's the official word.</p><p>00:07:34 Frank</p><p>So that's turn lights.</p><p>00:07:38 Frank</p><p>And then on now most people will argue with me. Is that technically this is the intent?</p><p>00:07:43 Frank</p><p>And this is the the destination or slot.</p><p>00:07:48 Frank</p><p>Lex calls us a slot and this is the state that you want, right? So ultimately there's 100 different ways I can say that, and this is what makes the really kind of an LP problem, right? Please turn the lights on or do would you kindly turn the lights on right bioshock?</p><p>00:08:02 Frank</p><p>Right there for you.</p><p>00:08:05 Frank</p><p>Um?</p><p>00:08:06 Frank</p><p>That sort of thing, and then whatever that happens, is that this will then parse that into an action, right?</p><p>00:08:12 Frank</p><p>Which, if you have smart plugs, it will then send a message back through the magic of the Internet and then turn the actual.</p><p>00:08:20 Frank</p><p>Oh, I like how that's doing that. Turn the actual light on.</p><p>00:08:27 Frank</p><p>Right, so that's that's basically solving the same problem.</p><p>00:08:30 Frank</p><p>Right?</p><p>00:08:32 Frank</p><p>And what's interesting about this? I just realized I didn't say it out loud for folks listening on the podcast, but ultimately what happens is my words get translated into an electronic signal, right? A sign? A wave of sorts.</p><p>00:08:45 Frank</p><p>And then that is then.</p><p>00:08:47 Frank</p><p>Re on the other side, it's then sent from the speaker to the cloud, where it will turn those that sound form that sound wave back into text, right? Or words and then it'll go through and it'll parse out.</p><p>00:09:02 Frank</p><p>What I'm saying is try to get an intent from it or an action to it, and then based on that, some other program that also lives in the cloud.</p><p>00:09:11 Frank</p><p>Mostly, we'll then take an action based on that. Does that make sense like that? Explain that clearly.</p><p>00:09:17 Andy</p><p>I think so yeah, yeah I like it. I like the flow.</p><p>00:09:21 Frank</p><p>Yeah, and it's it's it's.</p><p>00:09:22 Frank</p><p>Amazing how simple this is, right? This is not rocket science inside your average in inside your average you know echo device. You know it's not rocket science, it's just well, this one is the fancy one with the screen, but you know the the typical kind of .1 or whatever is a microphone and speaker in a Wi-Fi connection. It's essentially all it is, right?</p><p>00:09:42 Frank</p><p>So ultimately the the goal then is that let me see if I can D minimize minimize this. So the the goal is is that I have an example of that, and this is essentially a build your own voice kit that I saw at Micro Center for.</p><p>00:10:01 Frank</p><p>Like $5 or something like that.</p><p>00:10:03 Frank</p><p>An inside is a speaker, a button, and a Cardboard box.</p><p>00:10:09 Frank</p><p>And if you attach your Raspberry Pi to this.</p><p>00:10:12 Frank</p><p>You basically have a Google home assistant.</p><p>00:10:17 Andy</p><p>That's nice, yeah.</p><p>00:10:19 Frank</p><p>Shame on me because I bought this longer ago than I care to admit and I haven't built it yet.</p><p>00:10:26 Frank</p><p>But that's just to demonstrate. The point is that these these actual devices are rather simple in terms of, you know, just them being their own thing, right? So what's interesting about this, and this is where the cutting edge comes is when you when I talk.</p><p>00:10:41 Frank</p><p>We have our human brains or whole.</p><p>00:10:44 Frank</p><p>Some will debate about.</p><p>00:10:45 Frank</p><p>Whether or not I have a human brain, but let's let's go with you.</p><p>00:10:49 Frank</p><p>So.</p><p>00:10:51 Frank</p><p>The short of it is, is that.</p><p>00:10:54 Frank</p><p>I have the ability to understand context right from my previous statement.</p><p>00:10:58 Frank</p><p>So I'm going to mute some of these devices because if I start to hear their name, they'll start going wild. What's interesting is how good Cortana is at this. How good the Google assistant is at this, and how.</p><p>00:11:14 Frank</p><p>Alexa needs some room for improvement, right, right? So for instance, if you haven't caught on the shirt I'm wearing says cream cash rules everything around me, that's from a Wu Tang clan song, so I will ask this simple question from Alexa Alexa, who is the Wu Tang clan.</p><p>00:11:36 Speaker 3</p><p>According to Wikipedia, Wu Tang clan is an American hip hop group formed in Staten Island, NY city in 1992 original.</p><p>00:11:45 British Voiceover AI Lady</p><p>Hopes.</p><p>00:11:46 Frank</p><p>Alexa.</p><p>00:11:48 Frank</p><p>What was their first album?</p><p>00:11:51 Speaker 3</p><p>According to Wikipedia, the first album is the debut studio album by German dual Modern Talking. It was released on April 1st, 19.</p><p>00:11:59 Frank</p><p>80 so you get the idea you and I know like if you asked me who they who the Wu Tang clan were an, then what was their first album? I would tell you right, right?</p><p>00:12:09 Frank</p><p>It does not have the notion of context. This is turns out to be very difficult problem for computers to solve. OK, because.</p><p>00:12:19 Frank</p><p>There's a lot going on, right? So if I start talking to you is like handy. I was at this great restaurant last night that and then we switch to another.</p><p>00:12:27 Frank</p><p>Topic.</p><p>00:12:28 Frank</p><p>Then</p><p>00:12:29 Frank</p><p>We would, we would then say, Hey where was that place? And then I would kind of know if you said place I would know what you were talking about right? That is humans have trouble with this right? 'cause I have many conversations with my wife that kind of go in different directions 'cause I have no idea where she's talking about.</p><p>00:12:47 Frank</p><p>But I mean it's hard for humans. It's really hard for machines, so let's try and see if Cortana does this any better. Hey Cortana?</p><p>00:12:54 Frank</p><p>Who is the Wu Tang clan?</p><p>00:12:58 Speaker 4</p><p>According to wikipedia.org Wu Tang, clan is an American hip hop group formed in Staten Island, NY city in 1992. Originally composed of rza.</p><p>00:13:10 Frank</p><p>Hey Cortana, what was their first album?</p><p>00:13:15 Speaker 4</p><p>Should I read a snippet from Wikipedia?</p><p>00:13:17 Speaker 4</p><p>That might be related.</p><p>00:13:19 Frank</p><p>Yeah, I'm afraid.</p><p>00:13:23 Speaker 4</p><p>The Wu Tang clan is a NYC based hip hop musical group consisting of 10 American rappers, rza, gza, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah.</p><p>00:13:34 Frank</p><p>There's a lot of members of the Wu Tang clan. In case you didn't know.</p><p>00:13:37 Speaker 4</p><p>Cappadonna and the label dirty *******</p><p>00:13:42 Frank</p><p>Hey Cortana, what was their first album?</p><p>00:13:49 Speaker 4</p><p>There might be something on Wikipedia.</p><p>00:13:51 Speaker 4</p><p>Should I read it?</p><p>00:13:53 Frank</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>00:13:56 Speaker 4</p><p>The Wu Tang clan is a NYC.</p><p>00:13:58 Frank</p><p>Based all right?</p><p>00:13:59 Frank</p><p>Well, in the past she did get that right.</p><p>00:14:03 Andy</p><p>Well, she wasn't completely off base, wasn't completely off. Now she she kept it. Seems like some kind of workflow thing put her into.</p><p>00:14:11 Andy</p><p>It shot well at at least identify the context back to your previous question.</p><p>00:14:16 Frank</p><p>It did on that's a new active. That's a new behavior. I swear I I used to do this demo all the time and depending on the audience it would be Wu Tang clan or you know Aerosmith, you know. So let's see what Google has to say. OK, Google.</p><p>00:14:32 Frank</p><p>Who is the Wu Tang clan?</p><p>00:14:39 Frank</p><p>Alright, you're not very talkative today.</p><p>00:14:45 Frank</p><p>What was their first album?</p><p>00:14:50 Frank</p><p>OK, the demo gods are not kind to me today.</p><p>00:14:54 Frank</p><p>But in the past this has worked on.</p><p>00:14:56 Frank</p><p>On home assistant, an Cortana.</p><p>00:15:00 Frank</p><p>OK, so.</p><p>00:15:05 Frank</p><p>So the reason?</p><p>00:15:05 Frank</p><p>Why we're doing this today, and I know Andy has a hard stop in a couple of minutes is because we are hoping to get data driven as a flash briefing on Alexa.</p><p>00:15:15 Frank</p><p>And.</p><p>00:15:17 Frank</p><p>Alexa.</p><p>00:15:20 Frank</p><p>So I was trying to do this whole surprise thing, but apparently since the demo failed, I figured I'd break into that.</p><p>00:15:27 Frank</p><p>Into that, but that's ultimately the goal. But I also think this is an interesting, interesting topic, because for a lot of folks, this is just this magical black box. There is listening, right? An you know it's not magical and it all comes down to math and science, right? An and the key is to understand, kind of how it's built. And once you understand how it's built, you can build your own systems and it's actually not that hard.</p><p>00:15:47 Frank</p><p>There are more moving parts than you would think, but ultimately it just comes down to.</p><p>00:15:53 Frank</p><p>You know you're taking that speed that sound data, converting it into text, then taking that text and then converting that back into some kind of intent in action, right?</p><p>00:16:04 Frank</p><p>Yeah, and then on the other side, I'm sorry, go ahead.</p><p>00:16:07 Andy</p><p>No, Mark Taylor just said it's a do loop and he's right, he's.</p><p>00:16:10 Frank</p><p>A do loop. We have Mark joining us again. Thanks for watching mark.</p><p>00:16:14 Frank</p><p>I really should ask this.</p><p>00:16:17 Frank</p><p>But unfortunately to be is a bit of a bit of A.</p><p>00:16:21 Frank</p><p>Not a nice word or not a professional word for LinkedIn.</p><p>00:16:25</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>00:16:28 Frank</p><p>But they don't have enough memory. I think not at all.</p><p>00:16:33</p><p>No they don't.</p><p>00:16:34 Frank</p><p>But it's an interesting. It's an interesting thing where you, you know, 'cause I'm a nerd. I have I happen to have all three different types, but you know, actually 4 if you count Siri. Let's see if Siri will do any better on the on the album question.</p><p>00:16:49 Frank</p><p>So Andy, we actually have 4 special guests.</p><p>00:16:52 Andy</p><p>Wow, thank you.</p><p>00:16:54 Andy</p><p>Not crazy, that's that's a new record.</p><p>00:16:56 Frank</p><p>Hey Siri, who is the Wu Tang clan?</p><p>00:17:03 Speaker 4</p><p>Here's some information.</p><p>00:17:05 Frank</p><p>Alright, so she basically.</p><p>00:17:07 Frank</p><p>Pointed to Wikipedia.</p><p>00:17:13 Frank</p><p>What was their first album?</p><p>00:17:25 Frank</p><p>So it did the transcription.</p><p>00:17:27 Frank</p><p>What I said is good.</p><p>00:17:30 Speaker 3</p><p>I don't recognize this song.</p><p>00:17:32 Andy</p><p>OK oh OK.</p><p>00:17:34 Frank</p><p>So I swear this it did work before, but I mean ultimately it's a very hard problem. In fact, one of the things that they showed a couple of years ago at ignite I or build.</p><p>00:17:44 Frank</p><p>They showed this concept video of this lady talking to Cortana and it was on her phone.</p><p>00:17:51 Frank</p><p>More on that in a minute. It was on her phone an as she was driving into work. She'd be like, Oh, remind me to tell this person.</p><p>00:18:00 Frank</p><p>You know have a meeting with them.</p><p>00:18:03 Frank</p><p>And then the the logic would then go and then schedule the meeting through the through the outlook calendar and then tell her you know so and so rejected the request. But they are able to meet 30 minutes later. Is that OK? Yes, oh and invite so and so to this meeting as well.</p><p>00:18:20 Frank</p><p>Right,...]]></content:encoded>

I could do all sorts of things there,&nbsp;where as&nbsp;before I, I guess. I guess I could go through fiber and find that selection, but I can't do it on demand and a lot of case you haven't figured this out by now. A lot of what Andy and I do is ad hoc. We don't really do we do preparation, but not to the degree that I think.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>We present it, we do so I think that what&nbsp;what? This gives us the agility&nbsp;an&nbsp;the cost point.&nbsp;So&nbsp;in a sense yes. did I replace a human being with an AI generated voice?&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;I did, but I wouldn't say that.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>I put her out of work because I wasn't going to engage her anyway because it $30 to $50 or more per engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>Wasn't going to do it anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>Right, so this gets into that. That real question have I replaced?&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>A person and the answer&nbsp;is&nbsp;yes and no. In in, in the strictest sense, yes. But honestly, I really wasn't going to engage her for at least another year to do another voice over.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>You know the podcast isn't well monetized right now. Speaking of monetizing.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>You can check out this cool shirt I'm wearing. If you're watching the video, it's the data graffiti shirt. Just search for it on Amazon data graffiti. It looks an awful lot like the obey stickers you might have seen up and down East Coast, and I think I've seen it in London a few times.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>Once you see it, you'll kind of. It'll trigger your memory. Also, we are looking for sponsors, so if you want to sponsor this show, hit me up.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>But&nbsp;so&nbsp;in a sense.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>AI has&nbsp;opened up&nbsp;an opportunity for us that was really kind of closed before.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>And I'm sure there's a fancy economic word or economic model for this, but this is just something AI has enabled that really wasn't going to spring the money for a custom voiceover.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>For every show.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;I don't know. I think this is worth further discussion, but I also think you know it's not exactly.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>It's not as a&nbsp;clear cut&nbsp;answer yes or no. It's&nbsp;it's&nbsp;very quantum if you will.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;with that.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>I'm going to.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1&nbsp;</p><p>Wish you a good day and hope you have a great weekend.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

a</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:12.770,0:02:17.300</p><p>call it a data point how about that Andy</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:14.420,0:02:18.860</p><p>I like it I like that a lot because the</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:17.300,0:02:21.770</p><p>advantage is that because I'm using a</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:18.860,0:02:24.110</p><p>product called restream that I can pipe</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:21.770,0:02:25.340</p><p>two different output so this is actually</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:24.110,0:02:28.190</p><p>going to Frank's world TV YouTube</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:25.340,0:02:31.400</p><p>channel our Facebook live feed and</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:28.190,0:02:35.180</p><p>because of the magic of automation this</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:31.400,0:02:38.930</p><p>is also going to be I'm actually going</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:35.180,0:02:41.360</p><p>to once this ends will see that it</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:38.930,0:02:45.530</p><p>should pick up the arm the video feed</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:41.360,0:02:47.570</p><p>from Facebook and then pipe that into an</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:45.530,0:02:50.870</p><p>mp3 file which should be ready for</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:47.570,0:02:56.180</p><p>upload to the scene so again it's data</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:50.870,0:02:57.490</p><p>science right in data magic it's not</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:56.180,0:03:01.400</p><p>science</p><p><br></p><p>0:02:57.490,0:03:03.890</p><p>I told that to customers a lot like you</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:01.400,0:03:05.690</p><p>know it's ok to fail because it's called</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:03.890,0:03:09.740</p><p>data science it's not in Dean in the</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:05.690,0:03:11.660</p><p>perfection so you know and and silently</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:09.740,0:03:13.700</p><p>calling it science what you say well it</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:11.660,0:03:19.010</p><p>failed but you know we weren't sure it</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:13.700,0:03:20.600</p><p>was gonna work so it's kind of so how's</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:19.010,0:03:23.270</p><p>it going I know you have a call in like</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:20.600,0:03:27.380</p><p>five minutes but yeah it's I'm I'm</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:23.270,0:03:29.150</p><p>waiting on someone and if they if they</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:27.380,0:03:32.000</p><p>don't show up that that's ok they're</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:29.150,0:03:34.010</p><p>busy it's a regular call with with</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:32.000,0:03:37.190</p><p>someone who subcontracts with me and</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:34.010,0:03:39.620</p><p>he's older but he is a data scientist as</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:37.190,0:03:42.140</p><p>well and he sometimes gets distracted</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:39.620,0:03:43.550</p><p>heads down that's why you pinged me</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:42.140,0:03:45.080</p><p>about five minutes till the call I was</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:43.550,0:03:46.280</p><p>like well I got a call in five minutes</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:45.080,0:03:50.510</p><p>five let's do it</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:46.280,0:03:53.180</p><p>I was upstairs drinking coffee when I</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:50.510,0:03:55.310</p><p>messaged you and I'm glad you did</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:53.180,0:03:56.810</p><p>this is our oh I like this Frank this is</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:55.310,0:04:01.370</p><p>you're right this is our vision that's</p><p><br></p><p>0:03:56.810,0:04:02.960</p><p>why we registered data-driven dot TV so</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:01.370,0:04:04.700</p><p>okay there's another reason we want to</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:02.960,0:04:07.340</p><p>register theirs right there's a reason</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:04.700,0:04:08.930</p><p>why we're distr dot TV but the real</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:07.340,0:04:13.340</p><p>reason we didn't do coms because it was</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:08.930,0:04:16.460</p><p>taken so well there was that full</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:13.340,0:04:18.020</p><p>transparency minor and convenience minor</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:16.460,0:04:19.670</p><p>inconvenience I turned it into a</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:18.020,0:04:21.950</p><p>potential opportunity to make it into a</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:19.670,0:04:25.070</p><p>video podcast but the and</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:21.950,0:04:28.010</p><p>look here we are so don't give up on</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:25.070,0:04:29.450</p><p>your dreams kids that's right no things</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:28.010,0:04:33.200</p><p>are things are going good here today</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:29.450,0:04:35.170</p><p>Franco a little busy it's um it's an</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:33.200,0:04:38.900</p><p>interesting time to be an entrepreneur</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:35.170,0:04:42.410</p><p>right in technology it's it's usually</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:38.900,0:04:46.520</p><p>feast or famine but there's a lot of</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:42.410,0:04:47.690</p><p>factors kind of weighing in on all of</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:46.520,0:04:50.480</p><p>that today</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:47.690,0:04:53.990</p><p>I think 2020 has been that kind of year</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:50.480,0:04:58.040</p><p>where it's just been you know one thing</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:53.990,0:05:02.000</p><p>after after another but Frank you and I</p><p><br></p><p>0:04:58.040,0:05:04.070</p><p>are both people of faith right and what</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:02.000,0:05:07.070</p><p>I say when it's good times and bad times</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:04.070,0:05:08.960</p><p>is you know we're in God's hands and a</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:07.070,0:05:13.760</p><p>lot of people don't like us mixing that</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:08.960,0:05:15.830</p><p>kind of stuff that way if you're if</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:13.760,0:05:19.300</p><p>you're don't believe in God then you</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:15.830,0:05:22.940</p><p>know you can take the stoic approaches</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:19.300,0:05:25.100</p><p>um anyway I mean well and we have you</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:22.940,0:05:27.410</p><p>know we had I remember a couple of</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:25.100,0:05:29.090</p><p>people that we interviewed brought that</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:27.410,0:05:31.700</p><p>up brought up the stove approach Brent</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:29.090,0:05:35.930</p><p>those are stands out right right</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:31.700,0:05:38.870</p><p>Raven the last one so and in Bob Ward</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:35.930,0:05:41.960</p><p>spoke a lot about his face right all</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:38.870,0:05:43.580</p><p>right at the end of it and I'm gonna go</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:41.960,0:05:48.950</p><p>I'm gonna go out on a limb and say I</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:43.580,0:05:50.630</p><p>still believe this room I mean something</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:48.950,0:05:52.130</p><p>I read it might have been from talev but</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:50.630,0:05:53.240</p><p>wasn't in one of his books it might have</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:52.130,0:05:59.060</p><p>been like a tweet or something like that</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:53.240,0:06:01.880</p><p>you know that wars and plagues happen so</p><p><br></p><p>0:05:59.060,0:06:04.490</p><p>frequently in human history yet we're</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:01.880,0:06:06.350</p><p>still surprised when they happen yeah</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:04.490,0:06:09.320</p><p>and that kind of that kind of stuck with</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:06.350,0:06:10.820</p><p>me and and you know if you are person of</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:09.320,0:06:13.280</p><p>faith Amen that's cool if you're not</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:10.820,0:06:17.720</p><p>that's cool too we all have to live on</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:13.280,0:06:24.130</p><p>the same planet we did until Mars is an</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:17.720,0:06:27.230</p><p>option then we'll share too but I mean</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:24.130,0:06:28.910</p><p>you know as someone you know you all</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:27.230,0:06:31.850</p><p>know I mean I don't not everyone knows</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:28.910,0:06:35.630</p><p>but you know I was at the World Trade</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:31.850,0:06:38.780</p><p>Center I had PTSD</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:35.630,0:06:44.510</p><p>and one of the lasting legacies is a</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:38.780,0:06:49.340</p><p>PTSD is kind of the the overreaction to</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:44.510,0:06:51.740</p><p>stress now to say the 20/20 has been</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:49.340,0:06:55.040</p><p>stressful here both for family reasons</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:51.740,0:06:59.870</p><p>I'm kind of side this is an</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:55.040,0:07:05.210</p><p>understatement and you know I you know I</p><p><br></p><p>0:06:59.870,0:07:07.220</p><p>it's it's it's very easy to cower and</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:05.210,0:07:09.200</p><p>kind of like just zone out and I've done</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:07.220,0:07:10.820</p><p>that like you can figure out when that</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:09.200,0:07:12.290</p><p>happened when if you would look at the</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:10.820,0:07:15.290</p><p>blog when kind of the post kind of</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:12.290,0:07:18.620</p><p>dipped as well as the podcast when we</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:15.290,0:07:21.760</p><p>didn't record but kind of I had this</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:18.620,0:07:25.370</p><p>moment of of clarity that you know</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:21.760,0:07:27.140</p><p>reading reading uh things you know about</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:25.370,0:07:29.800</p><p>stoicism it was a really good book</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:27.140,0:07:32.990</p><p>called the obstacles the way yeah and</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:29.800,0:07:34.670</p><p>you know there are two things in this</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:32.990,0:07:36.230</p><p>world right there's one way to look at</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:34.670,0:07:38.480</p><p>I'm paraphrasing but basically things</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:36.230,0:07:40.310</p><p>you can control and things you can you</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:38.480,0:07:43.490</p><p>know so things you can control</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:40.310,0:07:48.050</p><p>well you know laying in bed all day it's</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:43.490,0:07:49.220</p><p>not kind of fix it right and things you</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:48.050,0:07:51.680</p><p>can't control</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:49.220,0:07:55.180</p><p>you can't do anything about it so at</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:51.680,0:08:00.560</p><p>some point I kind of this thought that</p><p><br></p><p>0:07:55.180,0:08:03.110</p><p>how can I make this how can I be a</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:00.560,0:08:06.160</p><p>better person despite all this how can I</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:03.110,0:08:08.000</p><p>be a better father how can I be a better</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:06.160,0:08:09.590</p><p>technologist not gonna be better like</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:08.000,0:08:14.270</p><p>human being just in general right</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:09.590,0:08:15.890</p><p>because you know I I've listened to a</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:14.270,0:08:17.750</p><p>lot of Tony Robbins over the years and</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:15.890,0:08:20.270</p><p>some people like him some people hate</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:17.750,0:08:21.560</p><p>him but one of the things he says that</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:20.270,0:08:23.750</p><p>the quality of your life is largely</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:21.560,0:08:28.880</p><p>determined by the questions you ask</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:23.750,0:08:32.930</p><p>yourself and we're really off topic here</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:28.880,0:08:35.120</p><p>that's okay we live in a very odd year</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:32.930,0:08:37.219</p><p>but I mean you know if you ask yourself</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:35.120,0:08:39.740</p><p>constantly why is this happening or why</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:37.219,0:08:44.390</p><p>is this being allowed to happen by you</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:39.740,0:08:46.550</p><p>know some divine entity you you're going</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:44.390,0:08:49.500</p><p>to get answers that lead I think to</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:46.550,0:08:52.950</p><p>despair but if you ask your</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:49.500,0:08:54.900</p><p>self questions of how can I use this to</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:52.950,0:09:00.180</p><p>be a better person what can I learn from</p><p><br></p><p>0:08:54.900,0:09:02.490</p><p>this you're gonna put your head in a</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:00.180,0:09:05.250</p><p>better place now I'm not saying that's</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:02.490,0:09:09.570</p><p>gonna magically solve everything but</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:05.250,0:09:10.520</p><p>honestly and if falling apart isn't</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:09.570,0:09:14.640</p><p>going to help anyone</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:10.520,0:09:18.620</p><p>it's interesting the where you know</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:14.640,0:09:22.080</p><p>where the euler's overlap between</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:18.620,0:09:24.270</p><p>stoicism and and faith and where they</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:22.080,0:09:25.830</p><p>don't right and I think it's you know</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:24.270,0:09:27.030</p><p>it's a it makes it's important</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:25.830,0:09:29.820</p><p>distinctions and I think there's</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:27.030,0:09:31.980</p><p>different flavors of both stoicism enter</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:29.820,0:09:34.380</p><p>or is it a Venn diagram well I think</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:31.980,0:09:39.300</p><p>this would that you could probably get</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:34.380,0:09:40.650</p><p>away with a ban on this although since</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:39.300,0:09:44.070</p><p>we're doing experiments let me try this</p><p><br></p><p>0:09:40.650,0:09:49.440</p><p>let me try this yeah do your pen thing

I think we are now currently in lock down</p><p>so that road ship and has been postponed.</p><p>It has and wow what a you know</p><p>what an interesting time to live in right Frank.</p><p>Right right, we are recording this on April 15th.</p><p>You know it's serious when even the government postpones tax</p><p>collection.</p><p>True, yeah today would have been the day that your</p><p>taxes were doing US,</p><p>but they pushed it back.</p><p>I forgot three months for</p><p>months whatever. Yeah, yeah, three months,</p><p>but it's in Julies coming up on my birthday.</p><p>That's how I remember it.</p><p>Like I need another paper.</p><p>They give it kind of.</p><p>Yeah exactly, but you know it's been an interesting day</p><p>here.</p><p>This I live in Virginia.</p><p>You know? This uh, FarmVille,</p><p>VA Ann. I imagine you may have gotten different weather</p><p>than I did,</p><p>even a little more odd for this time of year.</p><p>This late in spring. It is extremely odd to have,</p><p>uh, you know, an overnight temperature in the 30s.</p><p>Not only that, but we saw flurries this morning.</p><p>I believe this is the latest I've ever seen.</p><p>Snow flurries. Just crazy.</p><p>Well, you're at a higher elevation.</p><p>I think I know. Western Maryland had some snow overnight</p><p>too,</p><p>so.</p><p>It could be definitely could be,</p><p>yeah. It's hilly here where I am.</p><p>I'm a little little East of the</p><p>mountains. OK, but it is</p><p>allergy season so we're having just loads of fun here</p><p>with that.</p><p>How's things going with you Frank?</p><p>How's the family well? Well,</p><p>we're</p><p>doing good. We're all</p><p>sequestered together, and Fortunately I don't live in New York</p><p>City anymore.</p><p>In a small apartment. Otherwise,</p><p>I think I probably would've lost my mind by now.</p><p>Wow, yeah we my have allergies,</p><p>and I think my older son is developing allergies,</p><p>so we're playing the plague or pollen game.</p><p>And so terrible</p><p>game to play, isn't it?</p><p>Especially when you're outside.</p><p>It's like, although I found that wearing kind of like</p><p>face masks and stuff does help the sneezing and actually</p><p>in watery eyes.</p><p>So yeah,</p><p>actually does so.</p><p>Yeah, I I.</p><p>It's funny like I watch TV now and they show</p><p>old clips or something and</p><p>I'm like they're sitting too close together.</p><p>And that's the truth. I've seen it.</p><p>I've</p><p>kind of noticed that too.</p><p>So</p><p>enough about enough</p><p>about the stuff that's</p><p>going on with that. I have an announcement,</p><p>Frank.</p><p>What's your nationality? I am</p><p>so excited about this. My 17 year old son Stevie</p><p>Ray has been selected to present at SQL Saturday.</p><p>Richmond is going to be a virtual event at nearly</p><p>the last Saturday of April to 25th.</p><p>He came to me about a year ago.</p><p>He's been going to these things with me for over</p><p>half his life and he came to him 10 months</p><p>a year ago and says I want to do one</p><p>of these. I think I can do a presentation.</p><p>How do I go about it and I said,</p><p>well? You know, pick something shiny as a topic.</p><p>And he actually doubled up on that.</p><p>He is presenting on how to install SQL Server 2017.</p><p>On on Linux, running on a π three a Raspberry</p><p>Pi 3.</p><p>And I was like, you know,</p><p>you could have picked something harder</p><p>maybe. No, but he worked on this and it's been.</p><p>I would</p><p>estimate he's got 4 or 500 hours on it.</p><p>I helped him out as much as I could with</p><p>you.</p><p>Know like technical stuff, but I was mostly kind of</p><p>standing back just to see if he was going to</p><p>do this and he beat through it.</p><p>Frank and he got it to work nice and right</p><p>after that he put together.</p><p>I think so too and I'm so excited we're I'm</p><p>presenting in the first slot a week from Saturday.</p><p>He's presenting in a second right behind me and in</p><p>that same channel so.</p><p>I just I'm so proud of him.</p><p>You know these proud Papa moments,</p><p>right? You gotta eat.</p><p>These are totally, totally. I'll</p><p>never forget the day my.</p><p>He was nine at the time he went.</p><p>He was over to play date a friends house and</p><p>he fixed their router.</p><p>So yeah,</p><p>now so</p><p>proud that's awesome. Well, Speaking</p><p>of Speaking</p><p>of being Super Smart</p><p>and probably at a young</p><p>age to we are we are very honored today to</p><p>have.</p><p>I'm going to say the Bob Ward on the show</p><p>today as our guest.</p><p>Bob works for Microsoft. He doesn't awful lot of speaking</p><p>at the major major conferences is usually on the big</p><p>stage and in the big room.</p><p>And doing keynotes and stuff.</p><p>The only bad thing I think I can say about</p><p>Bob is I've seen him at the past summit a</p><p>few times wearing a Dallas Cowboys Jersey.</p><p>Goodness, gracious Bob. I don't know what</p><p>to say about that, but.</p><p>Will will let you select.</p><p>I'll confess, I'm a</p><p>Redskins fan an you know,</p><p>understand because I'll</p><p>admit it now. On</p><p>recording, you know at least you're not an Eagles fans.</p><p>I</p><p>can, you know, Redskins. Was this rivalry from years ago</p><p>in the 70s right now?</p><p>Not so much for us.</p><p>It's the Eagles pretty much so.</p><p>If you're an Eagles fan,</p><p>I might have to</p><p>drop off the call right now.</p><p>But it it please I if you do not know</p><p>who</p><p>Bob Ward is Gogo, checking out,</p><p>popping his name into you know into your favorite search</p><p>engine and check him out in my favorite search engine</p><p>actually is is Bing so I can say that,</p><p>but he's a lot of talks about data you do</p><p>a lot of free webinars.</p><p>You do a lot of speaking an you know you</p><p>do more than just talk about this.</p><p>I know you're engaged with the future of SQL Server.</p><p>And the data products I want to Azure and we're</p><p>just honored to have you here Bob.</p><p>Welcome today.</p><p>I'm happy to be here.</p><p>Thanks for thanks for inviting me</p><p>today. Appreciate it. While we sure appreciate your time.</p><p>Tell us a little bit about what you've been working</p><p>on lately,</p><p>what, what's</p><p>cool, what's going on? You know?</p><p>Of course, these are interesting times as you guys started</p><p>off the call,</p><p>so a lot of the things that I've been doing</p><p>in terms of showing up at a big event personally</p><p>have altered and changed obviously quite a bit,</p><p>so there's a lot of pivot within Microsoft and even</p><p>outside of Microsoft.</p><p>But how do we do things more virtual and digital?</p><p>I spent over the last year and a half leading</p><p>up to the end of last year on SQL 19.</p><p>Our latest release of SQL Server.</p><p>I mean, I was just immersed from this from the</p><p>beginning.</p><p>Uh, an, which again landed ultimately in launching of the</p><p>product last November,</p><p>December. Over the Holidays, I'm up in Redmond when I</p><p>could travel back then the Redmond and I'm with my</p><p>boss,</p><p>but I'm talking about, you know,</p><p>what should I focus on in calendar year 20 and</p><p>he's like you know what?</p><p>It would be really cool if you could spend some</p><p>time in Azure,</p><p>which I had done a little bit in the past,</p><p>but not near as much.</p><p>So lately I've been spending a little bit more time</p><p>on that space on the Azure Sequel space.</p><p>Still doesn't mean that I'm not doing SQL Server,</p><p>that's still my my pride and joy.</p><p>My passion, right? So I heard you talk here at</p><p>the beginning about doing your son doing SQL Linux on</p><p>a pie.</p><p>I mean, that's amazing. I spent a lot of time</p><p>on the Linux side with SQL,</p><p>spent a lot of time doing things with Linux from</p><p>containers and so forth.</p><p>But yeah, doing little cloud work right now actually kind</p><p>of a little bit of my focus in the last</p><p>few months,</p><p>so.</p><p>Very. I'm sorry, go ahead friend.</p><p>So I may</p><p>have the distinction of attending one of your last public</p><p>in person talks,</p><p>Bob. I was in the session you did delivered it</p><p>ready.</p><p>Oh</p><p>OK it ready. Yes in February?</p><p>Well it's funny because I did the ready thing and</p><p>that was when the virus situation was all kind of</p><p>just just starting a little bit internationally.</p><p>And so I was pretty comfortable that ironically I went</p><p>to Charlotte,</p><p>NC at the end of February and I also went</p><p>to Charleston up to that.</p><p>'cause my son lives in Charleston,</p><p>SC. So I was there in Charlotte.</p><p>I did a little bit of an event there in</p><p>Charlotte and I did cover sequel 19 in Azure sequel</p><p>and so forth.</p><p>But yeah, it's it's interesting.</p><p>You are ready. When</p><p>I was there, OK?</p><p>Yeah, great session, great session by the way I I</p><p>so for those who don't know ready is on.</p><p>I think if they're if they're an active listener of</p><p>the show that I did a couple of live streams</p><p>from ready.</p><p>Outside the building, 'cause it's you know,</p><p>super secret of course. It's an internal event for to</p><p>get field people ready for technologies that are coming out.</p><p>Yeah we even did a workshop there on if you</p><p>got a chance to be part of that but um</p><p>one of the things I've pivoted on over the last</p><p>year and doing more of it again this year as</p><p>well is making sure not just doing a talk where</p><p>I'm up there just bloviating on slides and just talking</p><p>about technology and so forth but some real hands on</p><p>stuff so you know we did a sequel 19 workshop</p><p>at the past summit last year it all on GitHub</p><p>it's all out there and so we kind of did</p><p>a mini version of that ready very very popular 'cause</p><p>we were teaching people hands on like how to use</p><p>the new sequel 19 features how to deploy your own</p><p>container was the container what is all this kind of</p><p>stuff right.</p><p>Um, so we did all sorts of things like that,</p><p>and that's a big pivot.</p><p>Now for me is to make sure what I'm doing</p><p>anything publicly or even internally.</p><p>You know, can I get that stuff on a GitHub</p><p>site and make it readily available so people can try</p><p>it?</p><p>That's a fantastic idea and absolutely love all of these</p><p>ways.</p><p>We can now share code,</p><p>especially those of us who've been doing presentations for years.</p><p>It's it's awesome when you could stand up there and</p><p>talk like you said you could talk about it for</p><p>maybe 75 minutes.</p><p>There's not usually enough time in a 75 minute slot</p><p>to have everybody open their laptop and work through this,</p><p>but it's awesome, especially when you can put it on</p><p>these markdown sites like GitHub,</p><p>an Azure Azure DevOps. I've been using that a lot</p><p>now to kind of.</p><p>I've got some code in one location,</p><p>summon another. Love is that they can go through an.</p><p>I've started sticking the slides up there,</p><p>Bob Even so they can walk me through.</p><p>My slides are for me right?</p><p>All the notes are about say this then say this</p><p>then do that.</p><p>But it's it's incredible that we could do that.</p><p>and I know from experience just an watching you speak</p><p>at events like to pass on it that you did.</p><p>It seemed to me maybe I'm maybe I'm out of</p><p>line here but tell me it seemed to be you</p><p>focused a lot on.</p><p>On the clusters of the big data clusters in 2019,</p><p>yeah. I mean, it's obviously</p><p>one of the hero capabilities</p><p>of SQL 19, so I talk about SQL lighting all</p><p>up like I'm one of the few people in the</p><p>team to just cover everything we do in the product</p><p>in 19, right? But one big folks have that in</p><p>my colleague Buck.</p><p>Would you spend a lot of time in this as</p><p>well?</p><p>One big focus of 19 is this big data cluster</p><p>technology.</p><p>This is radical stuff. This is like you know,</p><p>people are used to the SQL engine,</p><p>which is great obviously. But then all of a sudden</p><p>now we're installing Hadoop,</p><p>were installing spark. We're combining it with big data technologies</p><p>all in a Kubernetes cluster,</p><p>and people are like. I'm sorry,</p><p>what did you say? Hadoop spark Kubernetes that's not a</p><p>sequel thing like?</p><p>What do you mean? So for us to come out</p><p>there?</p><p>And by the way, if you got a sequel license,</p><p>you just get this thing like we just allow you</p><p>to install this.</p><p>So that's that's one of the things I focus a</p><p>lot of time on is try to make sure we're</p><p>still doing that.</p><p>We're still trying to make sure we get the word</p><p>out that if you want to start building kind of</p><p>your own data Lake within your environment and incorporate these</p><p>big data technologies with SQL things like machine learning as</p><p>well big data clusters,</p><p>this is probably a good solution for you.</p><p>So yeah, that was, uh.</p><p>Big focus of 19.</p><p>Yeah, I will say</p><p>this is that I'm really impressed with the kind of</p><p>the thinking.</p><p>Is it in order to adapt to kind of the</p><p>big data world?</p><p>How much engineering is got into updating and improving?</p><p>Uh, and adapting to kind of this new,</p><p>bigger data world that SQL Server is done.</p><p>You know that big data cluster technology,</p><p>one</p><p>thing about it, the heart of it,</p><p>is that this technology called Poly base.</p><p>You probably heard of right?</p><p>And this? This is really us just kind of looking</p><p>at the landscape of the industry and realizing,</p><p>hey, we'd love for everybody to store data in SQL</p><p>Server like right ETL jobs and do all the converted</p><p>from all your data sources.</p><p>But the reality is customer saying I can't do that</p><p>like there's some reasons I really let it really can't</p><p>even move the data.</p><p>So Poly base which started in 16 we just took</p><p>that thing exploded it.</p><p>We're like, OK, now you can use Poly based access.</p><p>Anything you want. Literally with an odbc driver,</p><p>let the day to stay where it is,</p><p>but access it through like external tables in SQL as</p><p>that hub and then you know quite frankly customer said</p><p>like well,</p><p>I like that Hadoop thing,</p><p>but I don't have a hoe to cluster laying around</p><p>were like OK,</p><p>will just install one for you.</p><p>You know, listens to do for you.</p><p>You just copy files in there,</p><p>like even petabytes of files.</p><p>And you just access them like tables and will just</p><p>make it scalable and</p><p>queryable. Pretty cool. Yeah, that's awesome.</p><p>That mean that excites me,</p><p>because that's, you know. As a data scientist Emil engineer,</p><p>you know, whatever you know,</p><p>you want to call Maine.</p><p>Although</p><p>keep it PG. Uh, you know.</p><p>I mean that excites me.</p><p>That kind of that beyond kind of the Relational Datastores.</p><p>And you know that SQL Server is definitely catching up.</p><p>One point is for those who are not familiar with</p><p>Poly base,</p><p>what would you be? Your kind of your elevator pitch</p><p>for Poly base?</p><p>Keep</p><p>the</p><p>data where it lives, access it through the language,</p><p>or use 2T SQL. That's really what it comes down</p><p>to.</p><p>You know leverage or T SQL skills go access this</p><p>data.</p><p>Keep it where it lives.</p><p>Run SQL queries. Looks like a table results.</p><p>You know, brought back to you.</p><p>That's really what it's about.</p><p>Awesome,</p><p>that's a great description.</p><p>I would also want to.</p><p>I want</p><p>to ask you a question.</p><p>How does this relate to what we're seeing with synapse?</p><p>It's a great question. Synapses,</p><p>a complete platform as a service analytics...]]></content:encoded>

Technology companies have really driven up the</p><p>real estate recently.</p><p>I don't know, you know,</p><p>and you also have the opportunity that you know if</p><p>you don't have to go into the office at all,</p><p>why not move to Nebraska?</p><p>You know where land is much cheaper than anywhere in</p><p>California?</p><p>I really think that when the dust shakes out of</p><p>this and now that remote work is much more accepted,</p><p>I think it's. I think we're going to see changes</p><p>or unanticipated changes.</p><p>I always like to say that one of the most</p><p>powerful forces in the universe is actually.</p><p>Unintended consequences, so I'm really curious to see how that</p><p>goes.</p><p>I can also imagine folks trying to sell real estate</p><p>in this environment.</p><p>Must be having a difficult time because you're basically asking</p><p>people to kind of come and go into peoples homes.</p><p>If you are real estate agent and you are dealing</p><p>with this,</p><p>my heart goes out to you.</p><p>But if you like to talk on the show,</p><p>kind of about how this is impacting you,</p><p>I don't know. I think that would be interesting to</p><p>our listeners listeners if you if you're not interested in</p><p>that,</p><p>please leave a comment and we won't pursue that,</p><p>but I think it'll be interesting to see how the</p><p>data shows,</p><p>kind of the fallout in real estate,</p><p>not just immediately, but I think over the long haul.</p><p>You know why pay millions of dollars for a condo?</p><p>That's five blocks to an office that you're not really</p><p>going to have to ever really set foot in.</p><p>It's really going to become,</p><p>I think, at that point,</p><p>a lifestyle choice you want to live on a farm,</p><p>or you want to live in the heart of San</p><p>Francisco.</p><p>I think the same holds true for New York.</p><p>You know, any major city,</p><p>really. As long as there's good bandwidth.</p><p>Doesn't really matter where you are,</p><p>and I say this as someone that has worked remotely</p><p>for the better part of 15 years now with a</p><p>couple of exceptions here and then.</p><p>It's interesting to see, kind of how this is going</p><p>to shake out.</p><p>And originally I was going to post this and talk</p><p>about how I'm getting my vitamin D 'cause I'm out</p><p>on my deck overlooking a forest and but Facebook did</p><p>not. Facebook live did not want to seem to let</p><p>me want to post with that.</p><p>I'm going to get some more vitamin D from the</p><p>sun.</p><p>The further protect myself. And you stay safe out there.</p><p>And if you have any thoughts about future shows,</p><p>I'm dropping a new show on Monday with a very</p><p>distinguished guest.</p><p>But I will not reveal that name.</p><p>'cause I think any and I want to keep that</p><p>as a surprise.</p><p>But we had a great time talking to him,</p><p>so that should drop Monday.</p><p>Today's Saturday, May 16th, so that would be Sunday,</p><p>May 18th. See just did some math in my head.</p><p>Anyway, you have a great day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Yeah,</p><p>it's not a glitch. If you learn something.</p><p>So if if for some reason.</p><p>The you know what hit the fan then that episode</p><p>will be recorded at a future date,</p><p>so we'll see it will,</p><p>but we've got. We've got</p><p>a great topic today. You and I've been bad this</p><p>around I want.</p><p>I know it's been several weeks.</p><p>It may have been a couple of months.</p><p>We've been talking about doing this.</p><p>Right absolutely, and part of what motivates this?</p><p>An based on the release schedule that I anticipate this</p><p>will have already happened.</p><p>I'm changing jobs at Microsoft Woo.</p><p>At your new job. I will be the data and</p><p>the AI technology architect at the Reston MTC or Microsoft</p><p>Technology Center,</p><p>so congratulations. Thank you very much.</p><p>It's an honor to join such a prestigious team.</p><p>If you're not familiar with what the MTC is.</p><p>MTC is a Microsoft Technology Center.</p><p>There is about 80 of them around the world,</p><p>and they basically are meant to provide specific experiences.</p><p>Ends well as architecture design guidance for customers around the</p><p>world and it's an honor to be kind of in</p><p>that team.</p><p>It's very rarely does an opening happen in an empty,</p><p>so when one opened up in my neck of the</p><p>Woods is like I have to take it.</p><p>I have to at least try.</p><p>Right right? So Fortunately I am super excited.</p><p>And Uhm, 'cause That's what we say at Microsoft were</p><p>super excited and it's a great team.</p><p>Great stuff that they do.</p><p>They do a lot of work with the community.</p><p>They do a lot of work with customers.</p><p>It's just an awesome gig.</p><p>I'm really looking forward to it and.</p><p>Yeah, I'm really excited about</p><p>it. Congratulations brother. That's a great thing and I think</p><p>you're perfect for that job.</p><p>I know, I know, someone else in that job at</p><p>an MTC in the northeast.</p><p>And it's it's kind of a rare breed of person</p><p>that has to walk into that role because.</p><p>It optimally you have a smattering of exposure to all</p><p>whole slew of enterprise architecture,</p><p>an both both you and this other individual that I</p><p>know fit that mold.</p><p>You've got programming experience, software development experience,</p><p>and you also have data experience,</p><p>and it's just rare to be good at both of</p><p>those things I know,</p><p>but I know you're good at it,</p><p>and I know my other friend is good at this</p><p>as well,</p><p>so I just I just think it's going to be</p><p>a great fit for you,</p><p>Frank. I'm I'm excited, you got</p><p>it. Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>So with that, one of the things that I've been</p><p>ramping up on in anticipation for this job or whatever</p><p>opportunity I was going to go to next.</p><p>I was learning more about the quote Unquote traditional side</p><p>of the data world,</p><p>which let me move kind of explain my little worldview,</p><p>which is twisted and as weird as it may be,</p><p>it might actually be right.</p><p>I see this alot in my current current or old</p><p>roll current as of April 16th.</p><p>Role is that we have data in the I cloud</p><p>solution architects,</p><p>but there's a very clear line of demarcation between the</p><p>data scientist.</p><p>Part of the data in the icy essays and the</p><p>sequel veterans side of things.</p><p>So I actually had a call this morning where it</p><p>was.</p><p>It was very, very much laid bare 'cause we were</p><p>talking about that and that there's essentially kind of two</p><p>types of data in AI folks at Microsoft for sure,</p><p>probably everywhere else, to you have the RDBMS folks.</p><p>These folks have been doing sequel since it was aside</p><p>based joint venture,</p><p>right, right? That's their world.</p><p>Ann, you have kind of the big data open source</p><p>kind of tooling world,</p><p>right? The folks that are more comfortable in spark or</p><p>Hadoop or with the crazy statistics and math around machine</p><p>learning and AI,</p><p>right? You kind of have those two.</p><p>Rarely do</p><p>the two. Rarely do you</p><p>have a person who's. Comfort,</p><p>Rible and happy in both.</p><p>I am aiming to be happy and comfortable in both.</p><p>Obviously I'm more in the data science kind of world.</p><p>And part of my part of what I see is</p><p>the opportunity in this new role is to grow into</p><p>the kind of the sequel.</p><p>RDBMS traditional database world. That makes</p><p>sense. They are no. It makes perfect sense.</p><p>and I mean coming at coming at this from,</p><p>you know, we as we shared in each show the</p><p>past few days that we've recorded.</p><p>We've known each other for like 15 years.</p><p>And most of that time you were a professional software</p><p>developer.</p><p>You are a Microsoft MVP in.</p><p>I forget which discipline it was.</p><p>Frank, I know it was software development related.</p><p>I</p><p>think</p><p>the world has forgotten that this discipline never existed.</p><p>tablet</p><p>PC. Tablet PC right? OK and you did an awful</p><p>lot in there and I know there's a lot of</p><p>people out there working in what that evolved into mobile.</p><p>That benefited from the blog post you shared,</p><p>solutions. You shared an all of that,</p><p>but yeah, that whole mobile thing turned out not to</p><p>be such a,</p><p>you know, it was a trend it and it evolved.</p><p>To what it is now,</p><p>and having that experience, I think you're going to find</p><p>that that plays well into kind of backfilling like you</p><p>said,</p><p>or filling this other bucket that you want to go</p><p>after,</p><p>which is traditional T SQL an.</p><p>I know, I know, from experience and dabbling in machine</p><p>learning and AI.</p><p>I'm on the opposite side of the fence,</p><p>although I'm not really that good at,</p><p>you know. Let's say like DBA level T SQL,</p><p>but I you know I can hold my own in</p><p>there,</p><p>but if we are. If we're selling tuning performance tuning</p><p>to a client.</p><p>I may be involved in the project,</p><p>but rarely am I the person actually performing the tuning.</p><p>There are lots of people out there that we subcontract</p><p>as a as a consulting firm,</p><p>enterprise data and Analytics. We bring others in who are</p><p>better at that much better at that than I am,</p><p>and we have people on the team who are much</p><p>better than I am as well,</p><p>but it's. I think your experiences has his set you</p><p>up really well.</p><p>To make this transition and it will like everything else</p><p>right?</p><p>We talked about this in the other shows.</p><p>It takes time. And it's frustrating,</p><p>but I think you're well positioned to pick up this</p><p>skill as fast or faster than almost anyone else I</p><p>know just well,</p><p>thank you now you know part of it,</p><p>I'm not. I'm not completely like naive to the ways</p><p>of RDBMS.</p><p>I took sequel in college,</p><p>database design and college and my professor worked with card</p><p>in date.</p><p>So you know, like. You know,</p><p>I'm only two degrees of Kevin Bacon away.</p><p>From the founders of the theory,</p><p>so you know that's going for me,</p><p>but I never really got into just kind of the</p><p>nuts and bolts of it,</p><p>and I'm not. I'm not concerned about that.</p><p>I'm actually fascinated about it,</p><p>because it's just another way to solve the same problem.</p><p>Absolutely. Ultimately, at the end of the day,</p><p>you're moving bits around, and it's a question.</p><p>What's your philosophy? Or obviously,</p><p>RDBMS has a philosophy and it you know I'm not</p><p>knocking.</p><p>I mean, it worked well for 5060 years.</p><p>But now we live in a world where there's a</p><p>lot more unstructured data.</p><p>And how do you deal with that?</p><p>And how do you deal with it now that you're</p><p>not making assumptions about spinning</p><p>disks, right? Right there's a whole.</p><p>Kevin hazard.</p><p>'cause we haven't hazard.</p><p>Yeah who talked about that on our show that yeah</p><p>there still leaves it's 2020 and I would say still</p><p>most of our code is designed for that age of</p><p>the heads picking up seeking a sector an reading data</p><p>and then picking up again.</p><p>So there's there's a whole new opportunity where obviously relational</p><p>databases are going to still matter,</p><p>but it's just one of many tool sets.</p><p>In fact, one of the things that I learned when</p><p>I was doing start up with angelism for Microsoft was.</p><p>You know, having debates with startup founders who UR?</p><p>I will say I put them in a hipster category,</p><p>right? I worked with when you work with startups runs</p><p>the gamut between really like I mean like that this</p><p>person is going to be the next Steve Jobs to</p><p>this person is kind of like I think they're living</p><p>in their parents basement,</p><p>but rather than seeing unemployed they haven't so somewhere in</p><p>the middle you kind of what I have.</p><p>The hipster ones where they learned code because of make</p><p>the startup.</p><p>Now that's not nothing wrong with that,</p><p>but do you think that you're an expert in all</p><p>things technology because you learn to code?</p><p>Right, you know, and then you go to a person</p><p>that is supposed to help you take your stuff to</p><p>the next level and kind of talk down to them.</p><p>So right context this conversation.</p><p>So they were basically lamenting the fact that they wanted</p><p>to.</p><p>They wanted to have the reliability of.</p><p>Up an RDBMS, but they wanted to do it in</p><p>a note SQL type of environment.</p><p>An I was like that's</p><p>a fair. You know that's a fair thing to want.</p><p>I'm just all cards on the table.</p><p>Approaching that, architecturally, that's that's not an unreasonable request.</p><p>But unless and until you get into the engineering part</p><p>of it.</p><p>And that's where you start to see that you just</p><p>can't have everything that you want.</p><p>I mean, there's no single do it all type application,</p><p>everything, every software application ever.</p><p>And I'm going to maintain,</p><p>probably forever. They're going to be applications.</p><p>There's going to be some spot that I define as</p><p>a corner.</p><p>It's something that the application or server or what have</p><p>you doesn't do well.</p><p>And what you'll often find is there's some other application</p><p>out there that's available,</p><p>or some other platform, and it will do that part</p><p>well.</p><p>But again, that also has its corners,</p><p>and So what you're trading is pain.</p><p>The nicest way possible. You're picking your picking your poison,</p><p>picking your pain. What is it that you want to</p><p>fight?</p><p>And it depends on. You know.</p><p>Relational databases have their pain points.</p><p>No sequel. It turns out a lot of companies have</p><p>learned this over the past few years.</p><p>Also has its pain points as well so.</p><p>You can't always get what you want,</p><p>but if you try sometimes you might get get what</p><p>you need.</p><p>Awesome. So, so I</p><p>mean part of it is,</p><p>you know, sometimes whether it's technology,</p><p>anything else, you have, kind of these dueling philosophes an</p><p>there is a point where they just won't meet just</p><p>because of.</p><p>They're they're kind of philosophically opposed an you're right,</p><p>you have to kind of pick which one you want</p><p>to have over the other.</p><p>And there's cause and effect to that.</p><p>So with that kind of deep philosophical you were data</p><p>philosopher,</p><p>so that's good. So I wanted to talk to you</p><p>about.</p><p>We want to do a deep dive.</p><p>It's not officially a deep dive until I have fun</p><p>with my soundboard there.</p><p>Into data warehousing, what is data warehousing?</p><p>Where did it start? I'll channel A little bit of</p><p>bojack horseman.</p><p>What is data warehousing? What do they know?</p><p>Do they know things? Let's find out.</p><p>Well, yeah, data</p><p>warehousing in my opinion in my experience is really this</p><p>idea of of collecting data from all over different places</p><p>and placing it into a centralized location.</p><p>Now there's some distinctions and there's other scientific answers to</p><p>that question,</p><p>and you can actually build something that today is not</p><p>considered a technically a data warehouse.</p><p>You can gather all of the information that spread across</p><p>the enterprise in different places.</p><p>Into what's now called an operational data store.</p><p>Ann, it's not totally unlike a data warehouse.</p><p>In fact, I think the Euler diagrams have quite a</p><p>bit of overlap for that,</p><p>at least if we if we kind of improve or</p><p>add to the word data warehouse or the term data</p><p>warehouse with relational data warehousing,</p><p>there's a lot of overlap between relational data warehousing and</p><p>operational data store.</p><p>Wanna confuse that really with our listeners?</p><p>But I just want to make you aware if you</p><p>hear oh DS or DW or EW.</p><p>It could be that they're talking about largely the same</p><p>thing.</p><p>And when you think about like you think about supply</p><p>chain management,</p><p>which is a topic on everyone's mind these days as</p><p>we're talking about the economic impact of the pandemic.</p><p>Supply chains are where really where really way more important</p><p>than we realize and it's kind of like oxygen or</p><p>money.</p><p>You don't recognize how important it is until you don't</p><p>have enough.</p><p>An supply chains are like this and you could think</p><p>of a data warehouse.</p><p>In that terminology. The analogy holds for quite a bit,</p><p>and I'm going. I'm just going to use Walmart and</p><p>Amazon as you know,</p><p>is kind of examples of this.</p><p>They both have these distribution centers and they have these</p><p>network set up all over the United States,</p><p>probably all over the world and its places where the</p><p>goods come from the source and they're trucked into.</p><p>You know, they may be collected at other points along</p><p>the way.</p><p>But they're trucked into these large,</p><p>physically large warehouses and then stocked.</p><p>And then from there there actually shipped out to in</p><p>the case of Amazon.</p><p>Usually there handed off to some delivery service.</p><p>In the case of Walmart,</p><p>they're placed on other Walmart trucks that are shipped to</p><p>the stores.</p><p>The actual brick and mortar stores and that warehouse in</p><p>the middle.</p><p>That distribution center. That's what I think of when I</p><p>think of data warehouses.</p><p>I think of the the electronic equivalent of that because</p><p>you know,</p><p>there's all of these. You'll see especially at what I</p><p>consider an EDW enterprise data warehouse.</p><p>You've got a collection of companies that have been acquired</p><p>in mergers and acquisitions,</p><p>and they're looking at. I want to get all of</p><p>their data.</p><p>But they have and want to bring that into this</p><p>one location,</p><p>and that I want it there for a number of</p><p>reasons.</p><p>But one of the big reasons is so I can</p><p>query that data and I can learn how my entire</p><p>enterprises performing.</p><p>How's it working? And. And in that,</p><p>and now if I apply that Walmart Amazon analogy to</p><p>that to the data there,</p><p>they...]]></content:encoded>

He has more of that than I</p><p>do,</p><p>but I think he definitely gets his ADHD for me,</p><p>which this is Frank. We've talked about this about weaponizing</p><p>things that maybe hindrances in some fields an you know</p><p>that I hear some of that in Stevie's plans here</p><p>because rather than just go after one discipline.</p><p>You know, just pick up a discipline of engineering,</p><p>mechanical or electronics. You know he likes the idea of</p><p>kind of popping between disciplines and.</p><p>You know, I, I think that so he's kind of</p><p>leveraging the ADHD there.</p><p>Yeah, I, I mean I.</p><p>I think that if you can,</p><p>it's one thing to kind of play to your strengths</p><p>and quote Unquote fix your flaws.</p><p>But I think there's a whole new level of self</p><p>improvement that I've kind of discovered over the last four</p><p>years or so.</p><p>Is weaponizing your flaws. Yeah,</p><p>you know what we talked about this with anti fragile</p><p>right?</p><p>Antifragility and not seem to loves books on that.</p><p>you and I are both huge fans and I'm still</p><p>working on getting him to come on the show.</p><p>Frank I don't know. I don't know if we're going</p><p>to be able to pull that or not,</p><p>but I have two goals here.</p><p>Is you're well aware one is to make contact with</p><p>him and two is to not get blocked on Twitter?</p><p>Yes, so he's although if you're for the listener,</p><p>if you're not familiar with the lab he's been,</p><p>he's been on fire lately with Twitter,</p><p>as well as his one of his big sticks is</p><p>risk prediction and risk modeling and risk management.</p><p>Although he would call it something else,</p><p>and he would probably smack me across the face for</p><p>calling it risk management.</p><p>But honestly, it would be an honor.</p><p>Do snack Crossface by to lab in my agree.</p><p>Agree yeah, but he's on fire both on Twitter and.</p><p>He's making crazy money on this on the fund that</p><p>he manage is.</p><p>Oh wow, OK, I didn't realize he still managed to</p><p>find.</p><p>I didn't know either, but somebody reported that he made</p><p>either 360%.</p><p>A three 3600% or 36 times I don't know whatever</p><p>it is,</p><p>but he's in March. He made a ridiculous amount of</p><p>money,</p><p>partly because I think he predicted a lot of the</p><p>long tail effects of the Cove in pandemic.</p><p>Wow, yeah, if you look at him on Twitter lately,</p><p>don't get blocked for him though.</p><p>Please yeah, I'll try not true.</p><p>I can live without kind of that pseudoscience biohacker knowledge</p><p>from his Twitter feed,</p><p>but I don't think I could live without to labs</p><p>wisdom.</p><p>Yes, I'm here. Which again we will share that story</p><p>in full detail.</p><p>Later, you're laughing. I am laughing now.</p><p>We were going through that phase of.</p><p>A kind of anger denial and all that.</p><p>Now we're kind of laughing at it were accepting.</p><p>That's where we have accepted it.</p><p>An yeah, so we've gotten over it.</p><p>But yes, we need your child.</p><p>We have. We have ignored him and we want to</p><p>talk about his product now.</p><p>You gave him advice that he should Chinese.</p><p>He combines the more likely his proposal to speak would</p><p>be accepted.</p><p>Yeah, and you know this Frank from our relationship and</p><p>I've been doing this for.</p><p>Along time when I get,</p><p>you know, once I got to to be able to</p><p>speak,</p><p>I started reaching out trying to help others do it.</p><p>'cause it was such a rush and I had.</p><p>I had a couple of of men tease,</p><p>I guess actually present at the pass summit 2019 in</p><p>Seattle back in November and you know,</p><p>that's just a huge, huge,</p><p>great failing and you see the kind of picked up</p><p>on that as well.</p><p>You heard it when he was talking about his motivation,</p><p>part of it as he wants to be able to</p><p>help just as much as possible.</p><p>But yeah, it came to me.</p><p>I don't know ten months a year ago he said</p><p>dad,</p><p>I want to. I want to do a presentation.</p><p>He's been traveling with me to events over half his</p><p>life and.</p><p>He said, You know, the very first thing I told</p><p>him is,</p><p>I think that's awesome. You'll do a good job,</p><p>but here's what we're not going to do where we're</p><p>not going to get you picked because you're my son,</p><p>but I'll do the same thing for you.</p><p>I do for everyone else,</p><p>and I did. That was my next piece of advice.</p><p>Was my first real piece of advice.</p><p>Was picked something shiny, and by Shawnee I mean you</p><p>know something new.</p><p>A little edgy an he picked 2.</p><p>Uh, an when he first told me about it inside,</p><p>I was thinking that's a pretty big bite,</p><p>but I didn't share that until just now with him,</p><p>but he jumped right in on it.</p><p>Franken, I would estimate in the first couple weeks.</p><p>He probably put 100 hours on this.</p><p>After that. You know he's probably been averaging 50 or</p><p>so hours per month or so and I would say</p><p>he's got a good solid 400 hours into it before</p><p>he got it to work.</p><p>And that was a couple months ago.</p><p>He actually got it to where he got SQL Server</p><p>running on one of our π three is.</p><p>So yeah, that was that was a very,</p><p>very interesting way that happened to.</p><p>I solved it while hanging out I.</p><p>It honestly looked like I was building a weapon in</p><p>a college that was that was really where it happened</p><p>is I was setting in the lobby of the college.</p><p>My mother works at. And you know the HD MI</p><p>cable was too short sided hanging out of the port</p><p>and everything.</p><p>But you know I just kind of threw my hands</p><p>up and laid back and the desk lady kind of</p><p>looks over me like are you OK?</p><p>It was it was. It was a very interesting time,</p><p>but when I finally got it was just like everything</p><p>that I had been waiting for.</p><p>Just kind of crashed down on me.</p><p>All the money we'd spent on replacing the walls.</p><p>I was hitting my head into,</p><p>it was just it was.</p><p>It was worthwhile. We've been there,</p><p>Stevie. I mean, Frank and I both done that an</p><p>I've shared this story.</p><p>In fact, this is completely unrehearsed</p><p>I I've I've shared with people on a bunch of</p><p>different times.</p><p>When I talk in class is about this.</p><p>You know I will. Failure is normal and my demo</p><p>for that is I will walk down stairs on a</p><p>break and you and your siblings are homeschooled here and</p><p>I'll say guess what my code just did and what</p><p>is it that you reply in Unison user?</p><p>Exactly what you told it to exactly what I told</p><p>you right?</p><p>Not not what I wanted but exactly what I told</p><p>it to.</p><p>Yes. But you experienced that.</p><p>Go ahead, go ahead now.</p><p>You've experienced that, and what I shared with you as</p><p>we were going through,</p><p>and I do this with everybody that you know,</p><p>I have a opportunity and it's truly an opportunity.</p><p>It's an honor to mentor anyone when I have that</p><p>opportunity to share with them.</p><p>Listen failure. You gotta look at failure as the latest</p><p>step on the path to success.</p><p>And really, what you'll see is when you succeed,</p><p>the number of times that you failed will actually kind</p><p>of set the bar.</p><p>How good it's going to feel.</p><p>When you succeed. Was alright,</p><p>so yeah, no you were totally correct.</p><p>It was. It was the you kind of get to</p><p>a point where I explain this to it to my</p><p>best friend who was,</p><p>you know he works. He helps me work with this</p><p>as well.</p><p>And I explained it to him and the way I</p><p>kind of explained it was I reached a point where</p><p>jumping off a Cliff was preferable to continuing to work</p><p>on this. And, uh, you know,</p><p>I just kept pushing through it.</p><p>And finally, once you get to the end,</p><p>it's just everything sort of it.</p><p>Just kind of collapses on you,</p><p>really. It's like being in a building and it's just,</p><p>it just feels so good,</p><p>just all the all the weeks of hitting your head</p><p>against a wall and being angry and not figuring out</p><p>not being able to figure out why it's giving you</p><p>this error and that error.</p><p>And why is this breaking and why I can't get</p><p>Docker installed after I've installed it 3 times before on</p><p>the same kernel?</p><p>You know, it's just. It's all these things over and</p><p>over and over again.</p><p>Just finally hit you and you just go.</p><p>Yes, it's completely foreign to both Frankie.</p><p>Now we write code and it just works the first</p><p>time,</p><p>every time, right? Frank, Oh yeah.</p><p>No, it's true. He's never come downstairs.</p><p>I've never heard dead come downstairs and go Dang my</p><p>code didn't work today.</p><p>It's always just man that was perfect.</p><p>There's actually a cartoon where it shows the same skeptical</p><p>look of a person in front of a computer.</p><p>And it says my code didn't work and I don't</p><p>know why that was the first captain.</p><p>The second one is my code worked the first time</p><p>and I don't know why.</p><p>It again, if your code works the first time,</p><p>then either you forgotten something it didn't work and it's</p><p>just not telling you,</p><p>or you need to stab yourself with a fork and</p><p>wake up,</p><p>right, right? Or you kind of like something is bad,</p><p>so going something even worse is going to happen.</p><p>And what I anticipated, right?</p><p>Which I think a lot of folks,</p><p>I think you know. I learned this when I was</p><p>doing a couple of years ago.</p><p>This is back in the Windows 8 days when I</p><p>was in evangelism.</p><p>Uh, I spoke to a bunch of high school kids</p><p>and I kind of did this summer course on writing</p><p>apps and stuff like that.</p><p>And like I thought, I bombed it the first day.</p><p>Like really bad, because it just kept compiler,</p><p>kept happening problems and there were some driver issues and</p><p>I worked through it an I talked to kind of</p><p>like the coordinator with the local high school and he</p><p>goes no. That was awesome because a lot of these</p><p>kids,</p><p>they see how programming is represented on TV and it's.</p><p>Everything works the first time and I'm like looked at</p><p>him like we both kind of set in Unison.</p><p>Nothing ever works the first time,</p><p>and if it does, I'm very,</p><p>very suspicious. Very sets to write a lot of folks.</p><p>They think that they get there,</p><p>they get their hands kind of dirty with code or</p><p>stem an the first time.</p><p>If it doesn't work, they think it's them.</p><p>But no. I mean that's frustration is on Fortunately or</p><p>unfortunately a large part of engineering.</p><p>Right, and that's that's the that's the issue I run</p><p>into when when I tell people that I run into</p><p>or people that I know that I work with computers</p><p>and you know, they tell me stuff like Oh well</p><p>that's I'm not smart enough to that.</p><p>Or that's too hard. I could never figure that out.</p><p>And then there's two kind of groups and that's the</p><p>first group is well,</p><p>you're so smart an my answer is no,</p><p>I just spent a lot of time in it and</p><p>the other the other group that I run into is</p><p>that like are the people who have seen.</p><p>What's the movie called? The oceans,</p><p>movies and there like in.</p><p>They asked me how nice you know how it feels</p><p>when you finally hack the mainframe and get through the</p><p>Firewall.</p><p>And it's really just like the reality that you run</p><p>into when you start getting into doing programming and engineering</p><p>of any sorts really,</p><p>is that? It's nothing like what it's portrayed in the</p><p>movie.</p><p>In the movies, in the general consensus of how it</p><p>works is nowhere near how it actually works.</p><p>Right, right? I mean it it to everybody,</p><p>it almost seems. It's almost it's almost synonymous to rocket</p><p>science.</p><p>I've seen to the at least of the general public</p><p>that I've talked to is they think it's some sort</p><p>of thing that you have to go to college and</p><p>get a degree for, when in reality you can learn</p><p>it in your Mother's basement in six months.</p><p>Now that's true. Patience is under rated,</p><p>I think in our society and this and a lot</p><p>of the folks that what differentiates kind of someone who.</p><p>Is good at, this is just the patience.</p><p>The tenacity. I mean you've demonstrated this.</p><p>I think you've internalised it now,</p><p>right? But you know a lot of folks,</p><p>I think in result of this pandemic are going to</p><p>start pondering new careers as they should,</p><p>right? You know, just. It makes a lot of sense,</p><p>and I think a lot of folks have to realize</p><p>that.</p><p>Programming is frustration.</p><p>Yeah, it's it's definitely. It's definitely not a career that.</p><p>4. Uh, what's the word I'm looking for?</p><p>Not short minded, but sort of short sighted people who</p><p>look for instant gratification,</p><p>right? Although I would say that.</p><p>As someone who, as someone who has been,</p><p>I've never been formally diagnosed with ADHD.</p><p>But you know, people close to me have said I'm</p><p>high functioning ADHD.</p><p>Uh, which is? You know I'm not going to argue</p><p>with that,</p><p>but there's a lot of folks who were quote a</p><p>quote on the spectrum or on a spectrum of some</p><p>sort who who do work in Tech.</p><p>Which is interesting because I think part of it is</p><p>part of ADHD is.</p><p>I'm not an expert on this,</p><p>but is the ability to focus on one task for</p><p>a very extended period of time,</p><p>yeah? Yeah, hyperfocus, yeah. So if you are listening to</p><p>sorry,</p><p>go ahead. Oh, I was just going to say I</p><p>completely agree with you.</p><p>That's that's really how it is,</p><p>at least for me. I'm not sure how it is</p><p>for other people with ADHD.</p><p>I can't speak for everyone right,</p><p>but how it is for me is if there's a</p><p>task that I'm just set on completing.</p><p>I just do it. I mean,</p><p>it's it's hard to really explain.</p><p>I just have an idea and I want to do</p><p>it and I go and do it,</p><p>and I do it until it's done.</p><p>That's how it is. Yeah,</p><p>I think its tenacity is the real skill tenacity in</p><p>patients.</p><p>I like that and having an end in mind like</p><p>for me when I first learned programming,</p><p>this was. Steve, this is like probably Stone Age for</p><p>you.</p><p>I mean there was no Internet.</p><p>I didn't even have a modem,</p><p>but she probably even know what a modem is.</p><p>Oh, so, So what did you name your Dinosaur?</p><p>The one that you wrote to school?</p><p>Obviously. I know you had some for cleaning the house</p><p>is right,</p><p>but what was the name of the one that you</p><p>wrote to school back on I we called him Rodney.</p><p>I don't know why. Oh OK,</p><p>cool because my dad was Rodney Dangerfield then.</p><p>Which is probably another name you don't know.</p><p>I was gonna say. Yeah,</p><p>hold on 1 second.</p><p>Look that up in the Wikipedia.</p><p>Yeah, it's like it's like the Spiderman movies again where</p><p>he's talking about.</p><p>There's really, really old movies like back to the future</p><p>and aliens,</p><p>right, right? Yeah, that was,</p><p>uh. Now give me...]]></content:encoded>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this Data Point, Andy talks to us outside of a Waffle House in Raleigh about announcements from Ignite and his upcoming trip to the PASS Summit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transcript (experimental)</p>
<p>Hey all this is Andy an this is the beginning.<br />
Well, not really. It&#8217;s kind of in the middle of<br />
my trip to PASS Summit,<br />
2019 looking forward to getting out to Seattle,<br />
catching up with old friends,<br />
making new friends. And we&#8217;re in my Redgate shirt today<br />
friend of Redgate Awesome company.<br />
Love you guys looking forward to seeing you all too.<br />
And I am in Raleigh.<br />
I am at Waffle House.<br />
No one who knows<br />
me will be surprised by that.<br />
And. I&#8217;m going to grab a quick bite to eat<br />
catch the first flight.<br />
And I&#8217;ve gotta connect and of course,<br />
every now and then I Get Lucky and get a<br />
direct flight from<br />
RDU to Seattle but exciting news out of ignite yesterday.<br />
If you didn&#8217;t get a chance to watch those keynotes.<br />
You can watch him on YouTube.<br />
They&#8217;re all over such a an the crew dropped a<br />
bunch of announcements about new cool tech coming out very<br />
impressed.<br />
I was very impressed by a lot of what I<br />
saw there.<br />
SQL Azure SQL, DW has been rebranded that was a<br />
big one.<br />
Just looking at this whole approach where they seem to<br />
be using the technology that they built to stack new<br />
technology on Top of it absolutely love that approach.<br />
This is the little individual units of technology are like<br />
design patterns and seeing them put those design patterns together<br />
in these little chunks together.<br />
I liken it to Legos.<br />
And they built the you know the bottom<br />
layers already and now they&#8217;re building on Top of that<br />
it&#8217;s pretty cool stuff.<br />
And you know, there&#8217;s a lot of marketing<br />
mix in their marketing is not a bad thing,<br />
but from a technology standpoint if it does any of<br />
what they said it does it still pretty good leap<br />
forward an I&#8217;m sure that it does<br />
it probably does more than they mentioned so as I<br />
head out this morning to breakfast.<br />
I hope all of you are having a<br />
great day. If you can&#8217;t make it just passed summit.<br />
There&#8217;s past TV and they&#8217;ll be showing the key notes<br />
from the past summit,<br />
you can watch the ignite.<br />
Keynotes as well, and it&#8217;s going to be a neat<br />
week,<br />
Anna in technology, so you&#8217;ll be good.</p>

<h2>Neural Networks from the Ground Up</h2>
<p>Neural networks are an essential element of many advanced artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. However, few people understand the core mathematical or structural underpinnings of this concept. In this session, learn the basic structure of neural networks and how to build out a simple neural network from scratch with Python.</p>

explore the emerging field of data science.<br />
We bring the best minds in data software engineering machine<br />
learning and artificial intelligence now hear your hosts Frank Lavigna<br />
and Andy Leonard.<br />
Hello and welcome back to data driven the podcasts are<br />
we explore the emerging field.<br />
Some data science machine learning and artificial intelligence.<br />
If you&#8217;d like to think of data as the new<br />
oil and you can consider us Car Talk because we<br />
focus on where the rubber meets Virtual Road and with<br />
me as ever on this epic road trip down the<br />
information superhighway.<br />
Can I fill us up with more data cliches Andy<br />
is emulated?<br />
How you doing? I&#8217;m doing great Frank?<br />
How are you? I&#8217;m doing alright?<br />
I&#8217;m doing alright so you had a birthday last week?<br />
Thank you yes? Yes, I made another trip around the<br />
sun.<br />
Yeah, yeah, you know statistics show that the more birthdays.<br />
You have the longer you live that you know,<br />
I wonder. Though if it&#8217;s one of those false.<br />
Corollary&#8217;s just just not sure is that false positive.<br />
I don&#8217;t know. I think it&#8217;s a useless correlation.<br />
I was looking for how describing the same thing just<br />
in different terms.<br />
That&#8217;s true. We&#8217;ve sound smart when we throw these words<br />
around.<br />
I need all the help I can get sound in<br />
smaller.<br />
I&#8217;m just saying so last week.<br />
We had the jihadis show kicking off season 3.<br />
Let&#8217;s see 02 of season 3 and.<br />
We&#8217;ve had a lot of good feedback with that JLD<br />
himself actually treated the.<br />
The.<br />
The episode. Lydia Oh wow,<br />
I was super excited with to hear that.<br />
We also announced speaking of super excited.<br />
I&#8217;m doing a play on super we announced the data<br />
Soup Summit and so that&#8217;s a virtual summit that were<br />
put together data soupsummit.com if I&#8217;m correct and coming up<br />
in. We&#8217;re recording this on the 29th of July 2019<br />
and it&#8217;s coming up in just under 16 days interesting<br />
concept.<br />
Now we&#8217;re having people record their sessions an it&#8217;s for<br />
a couple reasons.<br />
One is it&#8217;s the middle of the night in some<br />
of the places where the authors live so the presenters<br />
will be probably be asleep when we&#8217;re playing their recording,<br />
but we&#8217;re setting up forms and stuff like that,<br />
for questions and we&#8217;re just trying something new,<br />
and differentso.com. And if you sign up before August 5th.<br />
Then you will get a discount if you use 70%<br />
discount if you use the code data driven?<br />
And beyond that, you&#8217;ll get a 50%<br />
discount because we love our list.<br />
We absolutely do. They&#8217;re the greatest listers of our podcast<br />
ever?<br />
I would say totally totally speaking of funny correlation?<br />
Or redundant correlations, maybe that&#8217;s that&#8217;s the phrase,<br />
We&#8217;re looking for but I think one of the one<br />
of the key advantages here people like well?<br />
Why are you doing a virtual summit one we can<br />
kind of recruit talent from around the world and we<br />
can do it now as opposed to some distant point<br />
in future when if we do hit the Lotto or<br />
whatever.<br />
Well, you now we talked about this.<br />
A little bit. Indiana first show last week when we<br />
did organizing it was a lot of that was coordinating<br />
when people were available and.<br />
And that sort of stuff and you&#8217;re competing nowadays in<br />
you know against all of these other events that are<br />
out there in the calendar.<br />
Just keeps growing with all of these events that people<br />
want to attend that we can have folks record their<br />
session.<br />
We can play it back and then jump in the<br />
middle and do commentary and what have you and then<br />
we can actually compile those recordings and people can at<br />
a later date sign up and listen to the recording<br />
so there&#8217;s a lot to like about this.<br />
I think it solves a couple of particularly nasty organizational<br />
problems.<br />
And I love it and I love our guest if<br />
you go today to seesummit.com you can see the people<br />
that are speaking in this first one.<br />
There always is in my opinion,<br />
so looking forward to doing more of these we haven&#8217;t<br />
talked about our future plans for these much.<br />
But we&#8217;re going to talk about those after we get<br />
through with this one that&#8217;s right.<br />
We want to get the first one.<br />
The result and kind of see how it goes.<br />
We are using somebody elses software as a solution platform?<br />
Which. It&#8217;s always easier to find the flaws and somebody<br />
else is software,<br />
it necessary. It&#8217;s almost like that&#8217;s a universal pattern of<br />
humanity.<br />
I don&#8217;t know splinters and planks and all that.<br />
But with that. Let&#8217;s get onto our guest &#8217;cause.<br />
I hear he&#8217;s a pretty awesome guy.<br />
I&#8217;ve heard his name come up quite a bit with<br />
the work.<br />
You&#8217;ve done and some other places always in respectful tones<br />
just.<br />
With that out, there just engaged.<br />
I&#8217;ll send you send you that dollar by PayPal.<br />
Later, you work with them more closely want you do<br />
the intro Andy.<br />
Well, I&#8217;m not totally wing.<br />
This introduction our guest today from sunny San Diego.<br />
California is Brent Ozar and I consider Brenda Friend.<br />
No matter what he says about Maine.<br />
We met actually we met on Twitter and I want<br />
to say it was 2007.<br />
Something like that, and around 2008 or 9.<br />
I landed in Seattle for a pass summit aunt,<br />
we did. I think I actually used my phone it<br />
may be the first week.<br />
I sent on my phone had said you know,<br />
I&#8217;m at the airport is anybody want to share a<br />
ride or something like that,<br />
and Brett comes back and says.<br />
Hey, I gotta car. I&#8217;ll come get back.<br />
We pick me up and we rode from the Seatac<br />
downtown Seattle.<br />
How to great conversation. If I remember right you will<br />
find this ironic people who follow both their blogs.<br />
These days at the time.<br />
Brent was just getting started with this blog and he<br />
was actually picking my brain for ideas.<br />
That&#8217;s ironic now &#8217;cause Brent is he&#8217;s a master of<br />
marketing through and Anna Master or Microsoft.<br />
Certified Master SQL DBA. He was an MVP I think<br />
you stepped away from the Microsoft MVP program.<br />
Yeah. I did that and then I jump back in<br />
so but great guy brentozar.com.<br />
ZAR is those are if you don&#8217;t know who Brent<br />
is he&#8217;s he&#8217;s very popular in our community.<br />
Great Speaker One and in Japan,<br />
too great. Great speaker, handsome fella helper of folks with<br />
database problems walk with the shell.<br />
Brett I gotta cut us where you really get into<br />
trouble and so we&#8217;re going to regret.<br />
Well, thank thank God it is totally a pleasure to<br />
hear thanks guys.<br />
It&#8217;s funny hearing that big long winded introduction.<br />
I&#8217;m like OK now seriously.<br />
There are people who are important and worthy of that.<br />
I am not well. You&#8217;ve got engineers to season.<br />
I tell people that all the time is same way.<br />
It&#8217;s like we think the stuff we know is worth<br />
very little and stuff.<br />
Others know that we don&#8217;t know well.<br />
That&#8217;s like millions and it&#8217;s just a hard thing,<br />
but you have done an awful lot you sold out.<br />
Pass Summit Pre Conference sessions,<br />
yet and presented all over the world.<br />
The marketing is not to be not to be besmirched.<br />
That&#8217;s that&#8217;s really important an I am I cannot snatch<br />
the Pebble from your hands.<br />
I did might I think when I talk to so<br />
many people about what you&#8217;re going to do for your<br />
career and what your long term perspectives look like the<br />
thing I can&#8217;t say enough to people is that you<br />
already know enough technically you have enough technical knowledge to<br />
get the job done for a long time in your<br />
career. It&#8217;s that not enough.<br />
Other people know you know that more people.<br />
No need to know what you know you need to<br />
get out there on the blogs social media whatever in<br />
order to say.<br />
Here&#8217;s the stuff that good at but Frank about here<br />
are the areas where I don&#8217;t have expertise yet.<br />
But if you want to pay me,<br />
I&#8217;ll go learn those things.<br />
But these are the little areas where I presented expertise<br />
on and if you want to save time you can<br />
hire me and avoid the same burn marks that I&#8217;ve<br />
got.<br />
Yeah, absolutely I think that&#8217;s that&#8217;s the marketing pieces.<br />
What makes careers so much more stronger.<br />
The difference between y&#8217;all sitting out there on the other<br />
side of the podcast those of you who are hearing.<br />
The difference that it&#8217;s going to make to get on<br />
to the other side of the microphone to become podcast<br />
guests to start sharing your knowledge,<br />
a user groups. That&#8217;s when your career really hits the<br />
gas it&#8217;s bananas.<br />
Now that&#8217;s absolutely true, I can speak from personal experience<br />
is that the more you share the more you get<br />
and you know it&#8217;s just we&#8217;ve gotten a lot of<br />
we put a lot into the podcast.<br />
But I think we&#8217;ve got a lot more out of<br />
it,<br />
then we put in its especially so important.<br />
In this day and age where tools are changing continuously<br />
techniques are changing continuously and it&#8217;s so easy to sit<br />
on the sidelines and go well.<br />
Everything I&#8217;m learning is just via googling.<br />
That same as everybody else out here,<br />
we&#8217;re all learning this stuff and building the tools as<br />
fast as we can.<br />
Is that all you have to do is jump in<br />
take the plunge and start giving back to people all<br />
the sudden,<br />
it just makes a huge difference.<br />
Absolutely and people shouldn&#8217;t think that you know just because<br />
somebody&#8217;s else is already doing it that they shouldn&#8217;t try<br />
it themselves.<br />
Because you&#8217;re going to bring your own unique voice right<br />
so one of the things that I&#8217;d like to point<br />
out is that?<br />
Podcasting&#8217;s been around since at least 20042 thousand 5.<br />
Yeah, there&#8217;s a number of podcasters that have started you<br />
know as recently as 23 years ago and I&#8217;ve had<br />
enormous success.<br />
You know if you look at John Lee Dumas right<br />
like I forget what he makes like 100 thousand dollars<br />
a month or something like that.<br />
On this podcast or whatever and he only started in<br />
2012.<br />
This is not there is not so much,<br />
saying such thing as being kind of too late for<br />
this.<br />
It&#8217;s just like musicians or poets or artists or anything<br />
like well.<br />
Why would I write a love song in the year<br />
2019.<br />
Everybody&#8217;s already covered love extensively.<br />
You know it&#8217;s it&#8217;s all about what you bring to<br />
it,<br />
and how you can bring things to life that sooner.<br />
There&#8217;s going to be somebody who&#8217;s waiting to hear the<br />
way you&#8217;re going to bring it to life.<br />
That&#8217;s going to be different.<br />
Now we are not by any means,<br />
saying that you should go start podcasting about love,<br />
but you know in terms of data or development or<br />
anything like that.<br />
The market is wide freaking open get out there and<br />
share what you know,<br />
so, so true. And you&#8217;ve encouraged a lot of people<br />
through your blog Brent to begin blogging you&#8217;ve gone beyond<br />
that,<br />
at times. You&#8217;ve I remember your week of starting a<br />
blog.<br />
I still send people to that series and it was<br />
written years ago,<br />
but it&#8217;s still relevant and it&#8217;s just really good advice.<br />
Thanks, it&#8217;s tough for us his data people too because<br />
I like I&#8217;m so for background on me.<br />
I got started in development when into systems administration,<br />
then gradually segued into database administrator.<br />
When you&#8217;re a data person and you&#8217;re looking at like<br />
website.<br />
Analytics of the people who are reading.<br />
You and it&#8217;s 0000 for 6 months that disheartening but<br />
you just remember sooner or later.<br />
You&#8217;re going to help people in those numbers are going<br />
to start becoming larger.<br />
It&#8217;s just like starting a company or anything else starting<br />
your career.<br />
The numbers were tiny when you started your career in<br />
the beginning,<br />
you&#8217;re like, Oh my God.<br />
Can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m actually getting paid to do this and<br />
then generally overtime.<br />
Later, it starts. It&#8217;s not just about numbers.<br />
It&#8217;s also I think it&#8217;s just the weirdest things like<br />
I would write about how to do HTTP posts like<br />
screen scraping and you WP apps and then somebody would<br />
come up to me like I read your post.<br />
It was awesome. I&#8217;m like OK like wow.<br />
So somebody other than my mom read it.<br />
If you always took my thumb.<br />
I thought initially when people would start saying there is.<br />
Like why didn&#8217;t you leave a comment?<br />
Why did he tell me what &#8217;cause]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello and Welcome to data driven the podcast where we<br />
explore the emerging field of data science.<br />
We bring the best minds in data software engineering machine<br />
learning and artificial intelligence now hear your hosts Frank Lavigna<br />
and Andy Leonard.<br />
Hello and welcome back to data driven the podcast where<br />
we explore the emerging fields of data science machine learning<br />
and artificial intelligence is you like to think of data<br />
as the new oil then you can consider a scar<br />
talk &#8217;cause.<br />
We focus on where the rubber meets the road and<br />
on with me on this epic road trip.<br />
Down the information superhighway as he has been from day<br />
one.<br />
Season one episode, one episode zero actually we started zero.<br />
I take your room with me is Andy Leonard,<br />
whose has gone from data engineer to chief data engineer<br />
to you had another really data philosopher that&#8217;s what it<br />
was yeah,<br />
started with data philosopher back in today right which is<br />
very cool by the way well.<br />
I appreciate that Frank it kind of went with the<br />
beard and back then.<br />
I had the unbreaded version of the beard.<br />
And so you know, I still call myself so go<br />
ahead go ahead.<br />
Now, because I still call myself a date a philosopher<br />
at DILM Suite,<br />
which is kind of like an offshoot of Edna.<br />
They consulting company. I kept the title enterprise DNA for<br />
those not in the know not Edna like Dame Edna<br />
thanks.<br />
Yes, not the insurance company but enterprise data and analytics<br />
and.<br />
Yeah, we are I work there Frank works at Microsoft.<br />
Yep, which wasn&#8217;t the case during the whole podcast journey<br />
actually.<br />
Uh I had been riffed for Microsoft &#8217;cause.<br />
They basically said move to Seattle or else and I<br />
rejoined.<br />
But 18 months ago. Awesome has it been that long<br />
wow well April so.<br />
Yeah, well still fit OK 15 months,<br />
he was 89 since the job opportunity was like first<br />
presented to me.<br />
Right right so it&#8217;s been an interesting it&#8217;s been interesting<br />
journey.<br />
I&#8217;m now they changed our titles for this upcoming fiscal<br />
year.<br />
Microsoft fiscal year goes from July 1st to June 30th.<br />
I am now a cloud solution architect.<br />
Congratulations.<br />
I. I like that title better because it&#8217;s easier to<br />
explain it party.<br />
My cloud solution architect oh OK,<br />
it&#8217;s cloud its architect. Where before I was a technology<br />
solutions professional which?<br />
Requires a bit of a follow-up sentence or 2 well<br />
it&#8217;s vague.<br />
Yeah, it is vague so.<br />
It&#8217;s nice to have something that is.<br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s funny &#8217;cause throughout my tenure at Microsoft.<br />
I&#8217;ve always had those kind of weird hard to explain<br />
titles like evangelist.<br />
Right you right straight folks like you and gathered 99%<br />
of our listeners.<br />
We get we know what Evangel says right writing,<br />
but to normal people. They don&#8217;t necessarily like what like<br />
televangelists right like like religious religious right?<br />
That&#8217;s not quite like that,<br />
Well, you weren&#8217;t although some would argue maybe it is.<br />
Well II know you&#8217;ve always had a passion for community<br />
for those who don&#8217;t know that I don&#8217;t know that<br />
we&#8217;ve ever told the back story Frank.<br />
Back story you and I when we first met it<br />
was,<br />
it was November of 2005.<br />
I know that and I remember that because the netrichmond.net<br />
users group was just getting going or getting re going.<br />
I&#8217;m not sure. We&#8217;d kind of so when I moved<br />
to Richmond from New Jersey I had.<br />
Wanted to restart the group,<br />
yeah, and by the time November happened.<br />
We had a pretty good momentum going on.<br />
I think you were there when we were at our<br />
temporary location and we ended up taking up 2 conference<br />
rooms,<br />
which was about twice the size of the group that<br />
we expected.<br />
Wow, Yeah. And I was talking about starting up a<br />
Richmond SQL Group.<br />
And EDU Dot E. Who was the developer evangelist for<br />
the area at the time suggested I meet you?<br />
Very cold and I think I told you like yeah,<br />
just sent him on by you know,<br />
I&#8217;ll be here so.<br />
And he did an II popped in an gosh who<br />
was I&#8217;m trying to remember the guys name.<br />
It was be. I think it was from New Jersey.<br />
I want to scale Castro.<br />
It was Miguel Yes, and I didn&#8217;t come down.<br />
Yeah, that was a fantastic presentation.<br />
I had no idea who he was at the time.<br />
Uh. But he is an awesome presenter,<br />
He really is as very smart guy,<br />
very impressive. Just just all around and we also I<br />
distinctly remember meeting Nick Harris at that meeting as well.<br />
Oh really yeah. Yeah, so we were all just we<br />
were all kind of Newish to the Richmond area.<br />
I was born in Richmond.<br />
But I had lived in Jacksonville,<br />
Florida for the previous 3 and a half years.<br />
Anne I wish I&#8217;d gotten into community.<br />
Now there I really didn&#8217;t know much about the technical<br />
community.<br />
Although I lived in the area.<br />
You know in the Richmond metropolitan area.<br />
You know before I moved down to Florida,<br />
but It was it was very interesting an?<br />
You know, I kind of caught the bug and I<br />
think you and I were both at a spot in<br />
our lives where we had a little bit of extra<br />
time and we were both very passionate about this whole<br />
idea of community so we dove in.<br />
Now absolutely and it&#8217;s funny,<br />
you mentioned Miguel because Miguel and andem sack.<br />
I think at the time.<br />
He was known as Don XML,<br />
where the guys that got me interested in community when<br />
I lived in New Jersey.<br />
Cool, so cool, so which actually I think leads us<br />
to kind of our next topic.<br />
One of our themes if you will,<br />
for the year. &#8217;cause now there were 3 seasons in<br />
22 and a half years,<br />
maybe? Yeah, yeah in this season was a bit delayed,<br />
but it&#8217;s not been delayed as long as of Rick<br />
and Morty season,<br />
so count your blessings sitting at Barlow.<br />
I love Rick and Morty so much love to harm<br />
and I forgot.<br />
The other guys name, but anyway,<br />
so one of the things I think we want to<br />
want to kick off on is.<br />
2 things one is inspiration like what inspired us like<br />
you know what?<br />
What inspired us to get into data.<br />
What can we do to inspire others.<br />
It&#8217;s kind of pay it forward.<br />
You know like what inspired us to get into this?<br />
What inspired us to stay in this and how can<br />
we pass that onto our listeners.<br />
I think that&#8217;s really? I think that&#8217;s what gets us<br />
up in a day and keeps up late at night.<br />
And uh absolutely and then the other side of that.<br />
The other topic that I think bleeds into it is<br />
kind of takes into account our profession is tech intense<br />
it.<br />
Right and tech intensity is one of those newfangled terms<br />
that if you watch the inspire keynote.<br />
Last week and internally we&#8217;ve been using that a lot<br />
tech intensity,<br />
which is basically.<br />
Helping shit helping spread the knowledge of Technology,<br />
too.<br />
More people like basically turning up our technology skills just<br />
turning it up A notch.<br />
Actually, maybe we don&#8217;t like these other things that we&#8217;re<br />
seeing but whatever it is that there were passionate about<br />
positively or negatively.<br />
We share that exactly we just exactly it&#8217;s kind of<br />
like a correlation measurement right like if it&#8217;s the closer.<br />
It is to zero. There&#8217;s no correlation.<br />
But the closer. It is to -1,<br />
+1, there&#8217;s either negative correlation or a positive correlation?<br />
How&#8217;s that for geeking out?<br />
I like that. That&#8217;s got data science written all over<br />
it.<br />
It&#8217;s almost like it&#8217;s a podcast or not data science,<br />
which you do want so I think really the key<br />
here is and what&#8217;s really cool is over the past.<br />
Over the past 6 months.<br />
We both have had challenges you know in terms of<br />
deaths in the family.<br />
My wife was half, collage,<br />
she&#8217;s OK now that&#8217;s really what kind of is delayed<br />
the season from coming out,<br />
but also was part of that I managed to as<br />
part of my job is go and.<br />
Go through an actually. How people come up to me<br />
when I&#8217;m presenting at a customer site like how?<br />
Yeah, I love to show you know like tell Andy<br />
I said hi.<br />
You know it, yeah, yeah that happens to me with<br />
cool.<br />
It&#8217;s like you know it&#8217;s not just my mom listening.<br />
You know, and it&#8217;s not like AI.<br />
Bots that I program. I don&#8217;t actually have that,<br />
but it&#8217;s actually something. Wait people are listening to and<br />
we&#8217;re appreciate that we really appreciate that is so true.<br />
Well then II&#8217;ll just I&#8217;ll say &#8217;cause now I know<br />
Frank.<br />
You said all of this up so I&#8217;m not stealing<br />
anybody&#8217;s Thunder hear Frank did all the work once again.<br />
Frank did all the work.<br />
But we have 4 season 3 for this kickoff.<br />
We have a really cool.<br />
Guest all of our guests have been cool.<br />
I&#8217;ve said this before they are awesome.<br />
But this guest is a little higher visibility and some<br />
circles that maybe not.<br />
Our other guests have been as high visibility in an<br />
that&#8217;s.<br />
That&#8217;s a big tease. I&#8217;m gonna do.<br />
Frank I&#8217;m gonna let you take it from there and<br />
waited.<br />
This inspiration theme. I want to share with you all<br />
with our listeners.<br />
The guy who inspired me to podcast.<br />
His name is John Lee Dumas,<br />
he runs a podcast called entrepreneur on fire.<br />
It&#8217;s an award winning podcast where he interviews.<br />
Inspiring entrepreneurs, who are and his words on fire.<br />
An he has over 2000 episodes.<br />
If anyone posts more content on the Internet than me.<br />
It&#8217;s probably him 1,000,000 plus listeners a month,<br />
7 figures from his podcast of annual revenue.<br />
He&#8217;s known to his fans,<br />
is just JLD. And he&#8217;s just getting started.<br />
He&#8217;s he&#8217;s doing a lot of great stuff,<br />
he&#8217;s actually been in 2 movies.<br />
Documentaries not like Avengers or anything like that,<br />
but that is 2 more documentaries that I&#8217;ve been in.<br />
So you know much props to him and he&#8217;s been<br />
continual source of inspiration.<br />
You can better shut off my Alexa because soon as<br />
I start talking about her.<br />
She will start playing it.<br />
But if he actually has a flash briefing on Amazon<br />
Alexa.<br />
So if you want to do it.<br />
You could just ask play entrepreneur on fire right.<br />
He is a genius. He is a veteran you served<br />
our country in Iraq.<br />
He is awesome, because he he&#8217;s just very inspirational.<br />
He has a program called Podcasters Paradise,<br />
which we kind of talked about.<br />
A lot in terms of the training that I did.<br />
We always mentioned the training.<br />
The Frank dude? Absolutely, you kind of help get the<br />
podcast going?<br />
Yeah, this guy sounds pretty cool who were talking about<br />
oh it&#8217;s some gardening.<br />
John Lee Dumas. So Alexa Alexa always puts on like<br />
a little bit of a French twist on it.<br />
Like John Lee Dumas that is the roots.<br />
That&#8217;s where the fam comes from also another French Canadian,<br />
the call. Yes, danger danger danger Andy I&#8217;m outnumbered.<br />
It&#8217;s all good. It&#8217;s all good welcome Mr.<br />
Dumass. Thank you for inviting me.<br />
I&#8217;m looking forward to hanging out with.<br />
You too, for a little while so Welcome to the<br />
show.<br />
For those that don&#8217;t know.<br />
He just mentioned that you were in 2 documentaries one<br />
of which I just got the email about today.<br />
Do you want to talk about that age of the<br />
entrepreneur it was a documentary that features 24 pretty successful<br />
entrepreneurs and I mean,<br />
this team put in the work I mean,<br />
they actually flew down 2.<br />
Puerto Rico with a full team with the full video<br />
crew.<br />
We recorded all day I mean,<br />
it was a definite production.<br />
It was a couple of years ago,<br />
the filming. I mean, this takes a long time for<br />
these higher production movies to kind of obviously make the?<br />
Progress from conception to reality and it was really cool<br />
to see it come out and to sit down to<br />
watch it and to see people like Les Brown Russell<br />
Brunson T Harv Ecker Jenna Cucheron,<br />
just a ton of other successful entrepreneurs be apart of<br />
it and think it&#8217;s really going to move the needle<br />
for some people awesome.<br />
I was excited just watching the trailer cool well.<br />
I can drop a quick link for people to ask<br />
is it still free to watch it won&#8217;t be forever,<br />
but EOfire.com slash. Video you can go watch the whole<br />
movie for free and will be sure to put that<br />
into show notes and the next item was you were<br />
also I think it was the think and grow rich<br />
documentary.<br />
Yes, that also was a super highly produced movie that<br />
was actually the highest produce.<br />
I&#8217;ve ever been. I mean,<br />
they brought in real characters real scenes were shot.<br />
You know they would go back in time.<br />
And I mean that was some cinematography at hours in<br />
Preston.<br />
I just remember I was watching it.<br />
&#8217;cause I think it&#8217;s like Amazon Prime or something like<br />
that.<br />
And I&#8217;m watching and I&#8217;m like and you show up.<br />
I&#8217;m like holy crap holy crap?<br />
Yeah, we wanna things that I think really inspired was<br />
kind of talked a lot about this in a number<br />
of places about what got...]]></content:encoded>

They know that a displaced workforce would be bad political mojo at a time when the giant is facing increasing calls for regulation, even potential anti-trust action.</p>
<p>Anti-trust laws in the US were made largely in reaction to the Standard Oil Company and its founder John D. Rockefeller.</p>
<p>In this DataPoint, Frank notes how Jeff Bezos just may be the Rockefeller of our day.</p>

Rumor has it that there’s even a Data Driven logo on the booth! We are also excited to have Timothy McAliley as our very first “roving reporter” covering events and happenings all around the conference.…</itunes:summary>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>Hurricane Florence hit the US East Coast nearly seven weeks ago, yet the cleanup is on going and many people&#8217;s lives are still not back to normal.</p>
<p>In this DataPoint, Andy talks about the importance to remembering that there are people behind the statistics and data we gather.</p>
<p>Frank&#8217;s Thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What prompted me to think about this was how in the first few years after 9/11, I had shared my photos of the event with a researcher at NIST. In email exchange, I remember explaining to him that I would send him more data after I attended “another memorial service, third one this week.” He wrote back snarkily, “you know a lot of dead people.” To which I replied, “I knew a lot of people in the Towers.” He wrote back quickly, apologizing how his excitement for data collection got the better of him and he never really thought about the people who died and that he’s not just researching a fire, but a mass murder.</p>
<p>That interchange stuck with me and, as I saw parallels between our excitement about “Andy Weather,” I thought it would be a teachable moment.It also helped that he was down in NC to volunteer to help the people whose lives have been upended by the storm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andy&#8217;s Thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frank is spot on. It&#8217;s easy to get wrapped up in the numbers and forget that the numbers represent lives.</p>
<p>Hurricanes are massive storms. The damage they cause takes months and years to fix. Some of the damage &#8211; like lives lost or permanently altered &#8211; is irreversible. That&#8217;s easy to overlook in some moments and &#8211; often &#8211; requires a paradigm shift in thinking for data driven people (like me).</p>
<p>We should strive to help others at every opportunity &#8211; especially those recovering from disasters &#8211; because we are the only &#8220;us&#8221; we&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s data. But it&#8217;s not <em><span class="_3oh- _58nk">just</span></em> data.</p>

<p>Why? To see if he could. Even though the old weather station ceased working years ago, he still uses the data in SSIS training courses he delivers.</p>
<p>It was time for a new weather station, so Andy picked up this <a href="https://www.acurite.com/environments/weather-stations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acurite</a> model. He plans to use it to conduct data science and data engineering experiments. Why? To see if he could.</p>
<p>To get things started, Andy set up the Acurite software to append readings to a CSV file every 12 minutes. He then grabbed a copy of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AzCopy command-line utility</a> Andy decided to run the Acurite software and AzCopy on a very old Windows 7 machine (with only 2GB RAM). Why? To see if he could.</p>
<p>It works.</p>
<p>Andy built a command line for AzCopy that performs a data transfer from the old Win7 machine to Azure Blob Storage. He then used Task Scheduler to fire the command line every 15 minutes&#8230; and you already know why.</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>After attending <a href="http://datadriven.tv/datapoint-frank-talks-brian-moran-global-azure-bootcamp/">the Global Azure Bootcamp</a> with my son, I decided to drop in and see what bargains there were at the nearby Toys R Us.</p>
<p>I have fond memories of going to Toys R Us when I was a kid. However, I&#8217;ve noticed a distinct decline in the store over the last few years. Given the state of their business, I know I am not the only one to see this once great retailer fall from grace. It was a weird feeling walking through a store I had fond memories of and picking through its carcass like a vulture feasting on roadkill.</p>
<p>Naturally, the pundits will point the blame of Toys R Us at Amazon, but is that fair? Is it accurate?</p>
<p>Well, kind of.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bezos-explains-his-dreaded-one-character-emails-2018-4">Jeff Bezos recently talked about his &#8220;one character&#8221; emails that forwards</a> to his senior managers when he fields a complaint from the public. These emails not only strike fear into the hearts of the most senior executives at the online retailer, they also spur these leaders to act immediately to resolve the customer issues. What killed Toys R Us wasn&#8217;t Amazon: it was Amazon&#8217;s relentless commitment to customer service against large retailers who&#8217;ve grown lazy and content.</p>
<p>Now that consumers have a choice, they will choose to do business with those companies that provide the best customer experience.</p>
<h1>Ok, But How Does Data Fit into this?</h1>
<p>It does indirectly. From the article: [emphasis added]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So those customer complaints gives him front-line insights. <em><strong>If all of his data say one thing and a few customers say something else, he believes the customers. </strong></em></p>
<p>&#8220;The thing I have noticed is <em><strong>when the anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right.</strong></em> There&#8217;s something wrong with the way you are measuring it,&#8221; he explained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, as a data professional, those two phrases caught my attention. In fact, I see this as a failing in more than one enterprise: the assumption that the BI dashboard knows all.</p>
<p>It might, but it very well may not. If the data tells a different story from what&#8217;s going on in the field, then is the field wrong or is the data incomplete?</p>
<p>Put another way: If the map says that there&#8217;s a road and there is no road, is the map wrong or is reality wrong?</p>
<p>Clearly, reality is the ultimate arbiter and if you&#8217;re business is retail, then your reality is customer perception, not what the pretty graphics on your KPIs say.</p>

                    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After attending <a href="http://datadriven.tv/datapoint-frank-talks-brian-moran-global-azure-bootcamp/">the Global Azure Bootcamp</a> with my son, I decided to drop in and see what bargains there were at the nearby Toys R Us.</p>
<p>I have fond memories of going to Toys R Us when I was a kid. However, I&#8217;ve noticed a distinct decline in the store over the last few years. Given the state of their business, I know I am not the only one to see this once great retailer fall from grace. It was a weird feeling walking through a store I had fond memories of and picking through its carcass like a vulture feasting on roadkill.</p>
<p>Naturally, the pundits will point the blame of Toys R Us at Amazon, but is that fair? Is it accurate?</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p>I had been wanting to do create a podcast for a while, but it was a cold morning in November that kick started the podcast that stands before you now. As a fun fact, I had a podcast that ran for about a month in 2005, but it really lacked a focus and direction.  This time I was determined to do it right.  Most importantly, I was committed to doing it.</p>
<p>I decided to share some of the podcast&#8217;s origin story today since I activated my hosting account a month ago yesterday and after seeing this image flash on my Twitter feed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I decided that the time had come to seize the day. After getting a concussion that sidelined me for a few weeks, I realized that our time on this world is short and if you have an idea, run with it while you are still capable of running.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also an honor to be nearing the 4000 download mark so soon.  The show has been well received and well reviewed.  We really appreciate that and want to pay it forward by offering assistance to anyone who is also in that limbo between ideation and execution.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious about creating a podcast, reach out and I can help you get started. Also, I can&#8217;t say enough good things about <a href="https://podcastwebsites.com/account/aff.php?aff=538">PodcastWebsites.com</a>, if you use the code HOSTME at checkout, you&#8217;ll get free access to the stats package they provide. If you use <a href="https://podcastwebsites.com/account/aff.php?aff=538">this link</a>, it also helps support the show.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

                    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.krispykreme.com/">Krispy Kreme</a> is a chain of donut shops here in the US that originated in Atlanta.  If you&#8217;ve ever been to a Krispy Kreme, then you&#8217;ve probably seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu0ISv_GeHI">the machine that makes the donuts</a> that&#8217;s embedded in most stores. It&#8217;s fascinating to watch them go from  raw dough to tasty treat right before your eyes &#8212; all without human intervention.</p>
<p>Watching this process earlier today made think about the &#8220;impeding doom&#8221; coming from the rise of AI systems that will take away all the jobs. Such predictions have been made in the past and, while they did have some short term impact, over the long haul, job markets evolved and people found new ways to earn an income.</p>
<p>This time is different, however, warn the experts. But is it really different? What if automated technology systems can make a more desirable product (in this case hot, fresh donuts) a more viable business model.  For instance, Dunkin Donuts, another donut store chain, makes most of their product first thing in the morning.  While their donuts are tasty, they don&#8217;t have that &#8220;just made&#8221; taste or smell. I&#8217;ve not seen Dunkin Donuts make their donuts, but I imagine their system is not as automated as Krispy Kreme&#8217;s and, if it is, it&#8217;s certainly not as decentralized.</p>
<p>They may have a donut factory with the same types of machines, but they are likely centralized facilities serving multiple stores.  In short, it&#8217;s not possible for them to offer the &#8220;just made&#8221; taste and experience.  Without automation, Krispy Kreme couldn&#8217;t either.</p>
<p>With their value add of &#8220;hot and freshly made&#8221; donuts, they&#8217;ve managed to expand in a space already crowded with well established competitors.  As a result, their clever use of automation has created thousands of jobs and they&#8217;ve expanded internationally. All of this in an economy that&#8217;s been hostile to growth. (See <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/297017/number-of-krispy-kreme-doughnuts-employees-by-type/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/297017/number-of-krispy-kreme-doughnuts-employees-by-type/</a> for some raw stats on their growth).</p>
<p>So, will the coming age of AI eliminate jobs. Yes. In fact, it already has. But it will also offer opportunities for entrepreneurs and businesses that can deliver the types of products and services people want and do so in a way that would not be possible without that kind of automation.</p>
<p>In short, my faith in the future has been restored by Krispy Kreme.</p>
